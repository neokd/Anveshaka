        "title": "Web 3.0 vs. Web 2.0 \u2013 Why and How it matters for businesses?",
        "description": "It is a well-known fact that the internet has evolved from being static (Web 1.0) at its inception to today\u2019s interactive web medium (Web 2.0). This change is because of the radical evolution of the technologies, internet protocols, and demanding user experience requirements. We are now moving to the upcoming version of the internet (Web 3.0). These terms do sound familiar, but what is Web 3.0, and how is it different from Web 2.0? Let us get into the definition and details of Web 3.0 and understand how it matters for businesses.\n\nWhat is WEB 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 is an evolving version of the internet where users can view, write, and interact with content. To answer the question of what is Web 3.0, the brief answer is, it is the \u201cread-write-execute\u201d phase. It includes machine-to-machine communication and dynamic applications. This version connects decentralized data sources for a quicker and more individualized user experience. This is also where the metaverse is being built.\n\nIn this version, computers can understand data similarly to humans and intelligently deliver relevant content following user requirements. Web 3 is a decentralized internet that uses blockchain technology to protect your data. Instead of computer giants dominating the platforms, it will give consumers ownership stakes in the platforms and applications. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the semantic web will all be used in Web 3 technology and enable the execution of this phase. Computer systems will benefit from the semantic web\u2019s aid in comprehending and interpreting the context and meaning of the material. As a result, the end user receives the most relevant and precise result. Although platforms like Facebook and Twitter powered web 2.0, web 3.0 tech companies feature decentralized services or DApps. These DApps run on cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nWeb 3.0 vs Web 2.0 \u2013 Which is better for your business?\n\nSuperficially, both web versions are similar as the latter is taken as the base, and the newer version is a step ahead. Having said that, the nature of your business will lead to the right version adoption of the web. Let us look at it in a comparative manner to analyze it better, which can help you make an informed decision.\n\nUser Interface\n\nWeb2 offers a dynamic user interface providing excellent user experience with real-time updation of the information. The information being shared is controlled by the tech giants. Web3, on the other hand, provides data control to the user making it more secure. However, as it is in the nascent stage, it might be slower than web2.\n\nOwnership\n\nThis is the biggest change that Web3 has brought. The data in the web2 version is controlled by the centralized authority that helps provide a personalized user experience. The web3 version works on a decentralized principle offering complete control to the user.\n\nSecurity & Privacy\n\nAll the web2 applications are, though, controlled by the centralized authority, and the owner decides the security protocols of the data. Whereas the web3 applications do not require your personal information making it secure and safe. The information is provided in the form of tokens. However, this does restrict the opportunity to scale and would require a lot of maneuvering in case you wish to scale your operations.\n\nTechnologies\n\nApplication development on web2 entails the tech stack with various databases and languages like JavaScript, Ajax, and many more. Web3 application development predominantly leverages AI, ML, Blockchain, etc.\n\nTransparency\n\nBased on the control of the data, the transparency level with web3 is automatically enhanced. Blockchain technology helps create immutable entries that are easily accessible to users. Searches for products and services can be made more direct with increased trust.\n\nOperations\n\nThe operation on the web2 versions demands time and dedicated focus for streamlining the business operations. Web3 facilitates smart contracts enabling transaction ledger availability to everyone involved while providing real-time status and data.\n\nWeb 3.0 vs Web 2.0\n\nLet\u2019s compare and understand the difference between web 2.0 and web 3.0 based on specific criteria. Web 2.0 is primarily about read and write-level interactions. The web 2 vs web 3 comparison can be easily made by taking their distinct features and detailed impressions of the user experience they provide. For instance, you can see that web 3.0 places more of an emphasis on the semantic web.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe first criterion is the meaning of the two web versions. The second generation of internet services, often known as Web 2.0, allows for read-and-write functionalities and is thus called the read-write phase. Web 3.0, on the other hand, is the third generation of the internet and is the read-write-execute phase, emphasizing the semantic web. It primarily focuses on facilitating improved user and machine understanding of decentralized infrastructures.\n\nFocus:\n\nThe following crucial criteria for differentiating between web 2.0 and web 3.0 would undoubtedly bring attention to the main objectives of the two generations. The main goal of Web 2.0 was to make it possible for users to engage with online information. On the other hand, Web 3.0 encourages participation so that users can fully immerse themselves in online content. Web 3.0 wants to connect knowledge, whereas Web 2.0 wants to connect people. On a larger scale, web 2.0 concentrated mainly on tagging and end-user experiences. Web 3.0 emphasized empowering users by enabling better trust, privacy, and security. So, it is evident that the target area is an important consideration when comparing web 2.0 with web 3.0. Web 3.0 aims to empower people, while Web 2.0 focuses primarily on community building.\n\nTechnologies:\n\nThe underlying technology is the third key differentiator between web 2.0 and web 3.0. Several innovative technologies have aided in the development of both. AJAX and JavaScript are two significant technologies that have contributed to the development of web 2.0. Also, you\u2019ll see that among the technologies underpinning Web 2.0, CSS3 and HTML5 dominate. Then comes web 3.0, which is supported by cutting-edge technologies. The leading technologies supporting the foundation of web 3.0 are decentralized protocols, semantic web, and artificial intelligence. Knowledge bases and ontologies are also vital technologies supporting the development of the latest version.\n\nTypes of Applications:\n\nThe following criteria would be the kind of applications connected to the two versions. Web 2.0 is characterized by web apps. Web 2.0 applications include two-way websites, video websites, podcasts, and individual blogs. Web 3.0, on the other hand, encourages the development of smart applications by enabling them to use ML and AI characteristics. Web 3.0 applications that stand out include integrated gaming, 3D portals, and multi-user virtual environments.\n\nState of Data:\n\nAnother significant element in the outline of web 2.0 and web 3.0 distinctions is the status of the data. The network assumes ownership of the data in web 2.0. But Web 3.0, on the other hand, suggests that data should be owned by an entity and shared freely throughout the network.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe features are undoubtedly the last point of comparison between web 2.0 and web 3.0. Web 2.0 introduces a wide variety of web apps and social media apps while enabling improved engagement. It also makes use of interactive advertising. Conversely, web 3.0 offers intelligent, web-based functionalities and applications and relies on behavioral marketing. In reality, web 3.0 provides a beautiful illustration of web technology and information fusion.\n\nNow that we know the difference between web 2.0 and web 3.0 and the upgrades in Web 3.0, let\u2019s see how it will benefit the industrial sector.\n\nWeb 3.0 vs Web 2.0 \u2013 How will it be Different for Businesses?\n\nUsers can better control their data with Web 3.0 using decentralized networks. Privacy and security of the data have always been a concern for businesses that are better addressed in the latter version of the web. Based on these principles, businesses get the following listed benefits with Web 3.0 compared to Web 2.0.\n\nLack of Third-Party Intermediaries\n\nInternet usage has already transformed how businesses operate. Much more significant changes are coming with the advent of Web 3 technology. The increased ability to share and collaborate on data will probably lead to new business models based on these activities. Small businesses will be able to lower operating costs and improve their ability to compete. Web 3.0 business opportunities will be powered by decentralized blockchain technology, in contrast to Web 2.0. Information may be processed across multiple devices rather than a central server. Companies will be better equipped to manage and use their data to improve their products and services. Data-driven companies will be able to create new recommendations and offer services that were previously unfeasible. Also, increased data utilization would help businesses better understand their customers\u2019 needs and build products and services appropriately.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management\n\nThe advent of Web 3.0 companies will radically alter how small businesses interact with customers and respond to their inquiries. Customer relationship management (CRM) has historically been important to businesses. A detailed grasp of the demands and preferences of the customer is necessary to deliver customized services and offers that will increase sales and customer loyalty. Yet, employing traditional CRM techniques has proven difficult because they are frequently confined by the data, making it challenging to acquire a complete picture of the consumer.\n\nSocial media, surfing history, and other data sources enable Web 3.0 technology to help businesses understand customers\u2019 preferences better. This will enable them to offer customized services and, eventually, a better chance of connecting with customers. Sales will rise, and customer relationships will improve. Customers will also be able to put more faith in company data. In contrast to Web 2.0, data in Web 3.0 will be kept on decentralized networks, making tampering and exploitation more difficult. Access to accurate information about their transactions would be available to customers. They can see real-time supply chains. Consumers will be given reliable updates on the status of their orders, which will increase the credibility of the business. Web 3.0 has the ability to change how businesses interact with their customers and how they use CRM.\n\nSupply Chain Management:\n\nSCM refers to planning, implementing, and managing a supply chain\u2019s operations. It covers the movement and storage of raw materials, unfinished goods, and works in progress. Supply chains are used to produce and deliver goods and services to customers. By maximizing the flow of resources, information, and cash along the supply chain, one of SCM\u2019s primary goals is to meet consumer demand.\n\nTraditional supply chains have made way for increasingly decentralized Supply Chain Networks in recent years (SCNs). SCNs are networks built on information and communication technologies that include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other participants.\n\nNew Marketing Outlook\n\nWeb 3.0 will fundamentally change the game regarding providing small businesses with innovative and economical marketing solutions. Local businesses can now reach customers directly with mobile advertisements. It will open up a new universe of opportunities for sophisticated segmentation and marketing research for small business owners. Businesses may target customers more successfully by creating appropriate messaging with access to increasingly sophisticated and nuanced data on customers\u2019 online browsing behaviors. Some of the features of Web 3.0 are already utilized by apps that track real-time data.\n\nHow can Appinventiv Assist you in Transitioning into a Web 3.0 Business?\n\nWhether you are a startup or a well-established company trying to integrate the features of Web 3.0 and use it to maximize your growth, the essentials you need to integrate and implement the right AI and ML tools to take your organization to the next level can be achieved by partnering with\n\nA company that you can rely on\n\nA company with the right technology resources\n\nA company with experience in what they are doing\n\nWe at Appinventiv provide you with it all.

With virtual shops and monetized digital assets, Web3 will promote more incredible innovation and entrepreneurship. By creating a blockchain-based, tamper-proof record of transactions, Web 3.0 technologies can assist in increasing transparency and confidence between businesses and their customers. Customers can monitor where their products are at each stage of the production process using a real-time supply chain view.\n\nQ. How can a company use Web 3.0 technologies to gain a competitive advantage?\n\nA. Web3 will eliminate outside data brokers who don\u2019t often care about customer privacy. These businesses frequently collect data without telling the users and then monetize it. Companies that purchase this data later lose the trust of their clients. By taking data brokers out of the equation, Web 3.0 companies find a solution to this problem. In addition to it, it enables better customer relationship management, supply chain management, and a completely new marketing outlook.\n\nQ. What is web2 and web3?\n\nA. The \u201cread-write\u201d era of the internet, or Web 2.0, began in the latter part of the 2000s. It was an improved model that allowed for user and website interactions. A future version of the internet called Web 3.0 will enable users to view, create, and engage with content. This stage is known as \u201cread-write-execute.\u201d Versatile applications and machine-to-machine communication are included.",

        "title": "Exploring the Role of Web 3.0 and Crypto Services in India",
        "description": "Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, is the next generation of the internet that is designed to be more open, secure, and user-controlled than the current Web 2.0. It is built on blockchain technology and offers a decentralized network where users can interact with each other and with applications without relying on centralized servers or intermediaries. Web 3.0 has the potential to revolutionize the way we access and share information, conduct business, and even govern society.\n\nA bird\u2019s eye on the evolution of the web\n\nThe birth of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 was the beginning of the Information Age. The first implementation of the web, called the Web 1.0 or the \u201cread-only web,\u201d allowed users to search for information and read it, but there was very little in the way of user interaction or content contribution. The early web had millions of static websites, which mushroomed during the dot-com boom. The lack of active interaction of common users with the web led to the birth of Web 2.0, which allowed users to contribute content and interact with other web users. This era empowered the common user with new concepts like blogs, social media, and video streaming. Web 3.0, also known as the semantic executing web, extends the Web 2.0 concept by combining semantic mark up and web services, promising applications that can speak to each other directly and broader searches for information through simpler interfaces.\n\nSemantic markup refers to the communication gap between human web users and computerized applications. One of the largest organizational challenges of presenting information on the web was that web applications weren\u2019t able to provide context to data, and, therefore, didn\u2019t really understand what was relevant and what was not. Web 3.0, by combining a semantic mark up and web services, promises the potential for applications that can speak to each other directly, and for broader searches for information through simpler interfaces. The attributes that are going to be a part of Web 3.0 include contextual search, tailor-made search, personalized search, the evolution of 3D web, and deductive reasoning. Web 4.0, also known as the \"Mobile Web,\" is an alternate version of what we already have. It connects all devices in the real and virtual world in real-time. As the global crypto ecosystem has grown tremendously in the past few years, Web 4.0 will bring new opportunities for block chain and crypto currencies, and the way they interact with the web.\n\nThe future of Web 3.0 and crypto in India\n\nThe crypto industry has been rapidly growing over the past few years and currently boasts over 200 million users worldwide, with around 10% of them hailing from India. Despite regulatory uncertainty, Indian investors have shown significant interest in the space, and Web 3.0-based businesses are starting to offer services that cater to the global ecosystem. In this we'll explore the role that Web 3.0 and crypto services can play in India and how we must prepare for this.\n\nOne of the key challenges facing the Indian crypto ecosystem is the need for timely regulations that will create a vibrant and transparent ecosystem. The government has already taken significant steps towards this, such as the TDS on sales and the recent anti-money laundering provisions under PMLA. However, some compliant Indian exchanges have experienced a significant drop in volumes since July 2022 as investors migrated to using non-compliant global exchanges for their trades. To address this, Indian businesses that operate with local offices should be encouraged to become the partner of choice for the government and the \"platform of trust\" for investors.\n\nBlockchain Technology and its Role in Crypto and Web 3.0 Services\n\nBlockchain technology is the core technology behind crypto and Web 3.0 and is already implemented across industries. It is also touted as the base of the next big Metaverse trend. In this context, crypto and Web 3.0 services originating from Indian businesses can serve a multitude of use cases globally. This can attract foreign investments into India and create new jobs that will serve the economy and the youth well. However, this needs a consistent approach in terms of education and incentivizing businesses. We must prepare our youth for 5-10 years ahead.\n\nThe eRupee and its Potential\n\nAnother key benefit of crypto is the ability to enhance payments infrastructure in terms of time and cost. Cross-border payments via crypto have already given a boost to some countries. India's retail Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC (CBDC-R) started its pilot stage in December 2022, and the eRupee has several benefits, including faster and cheaper transactions, improved financial inclusion, and reduced reliance on cash. It is also expected to make it easier for the government to track transactions and crack down on money laundering.\n\nThe eRupee can naturally become the de facto onramp for crypto and Web 3.0 transactions, allowing investors to transact with crypto and NFTs only via eRupee. This can also be extended to sectors such as online gaming. With the rise of blockchain technology, we expect the e-Rupee to be integrated into decentralized applications, making it an integral part of the Web 3.0 ecosystem in the future.\n\nWhile blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new and complex technology that requires significant expertise to navigate. Consumer awareness and educational programs in various languages can help bridge this gap. Additionally, the inherent volatility in crypto asset prices needs proper risk planning by individuals and companies. While we anticipate the asset class to mature over time and decline in volatility, it is still years away.\n\nThe adoption and success of the eRupee is dependent on its use cases and regulatory clarity that accompanies its usage. The move towards transparency will keep the ecosystem clean and trustable. The future remains bright for the crypto and Web 3.0 ecosystem in India with the right interventions. We must act soon to prepare for this exciting and rapidly evolving industry.\n\nConclusion:-\n\nThe emergence of Web 3.0 and the growth of the crypto industry offer immense opportunities for India's economy and its youth. However, to fully realize these benefits, there is a need for timely and transparent regulations, as well as education programs that can bridge the gap in expertise and risk planning. The eRupee, with its potential to become the de fact on ramp for crypto transactions, can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the Indian crypto ecosystem. With the right interventions, India can position itself as a leader in this rapidly evolving industry and attract foreign investments while serving the needs of its citizens. It's time to act now and prepare for the exciting future ahead.",

        "title": "How Web 3.0 is Revolutionizing E-Commerce",
        "description": "The arrival of Web 3.0 has profoundly affected people\u2019s daily routines, and the development of eCommerce is expected to follow suit.\n\nOne factor that contributed to the rise of online retail during the last two decades is the increased availability of information online. The question is how Web 3.0 will advance the curve, but e-commerce is ready to adapt to the new conditions. Web 3.0 has made payment gateways like Visa, MasterCard, and banks obsolete for online retailers.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the significance of online shopping over the last several years and its promising future.\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 is the latest and greatest in internet technology. It is propelled by AI, sensors, 5G, the cloud, AR/VR, and other cutting-edge technologies that operate on a distributed computer network. The goal of Web 3.0 is to make the internet smart, autonomous, connected, and open by digitizing the real world and making it available online.\n\nElements of Web 3.0 Influencing eCommerce\n\nThere are several facets of the Web 3.0 revolution, and each one has a unique impact on online retail. We\u2019ve listed the various elements of Web 3.0 below.\n\nBlockchain\n\nBlockchain is a distributed public ledger that records and keeps track of information about financial transactions. To verify ownership without compromising user anonymity, it leverages connected data pieces. The data stored on the system is very secure and difficult to hack or modify.\n\nThis technology is all set to revolutionize the supply chain for online retailers. Decentralized ledgers will make middlemen, who may be quite costly, unnecessary. Online retailers with intricate delivery requirements would benefit greatly from this.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nTransactions in a cryptocurrency are handled via a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Money is transferred on the blockchain, making financial ownership decentralized and independent of governments and other authoritative bodies. It employs encryption to ensure the safety of online purchases and transactions.\n\nIn 2023, there are already more than 400 million bitcoin users/owners globally. According to a recent survey, the average order value for bitcoin purchases is two times that of credit card purchases. Customers will have more faith in your e-commerce business if you accept cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrency Alternatives (NFTs)\n\nNFT is a digital representation of physical assets like artwork and real estate. It may be sold or transferred because of its inclusion on the blockchain. Yet, it is not exchanged at par with digital currencies.\n\nThese digital representations are the equivalent of client avatars today. Thanks to tokenization and digital ownership, customers might feel like they have some stake in the business. Many uses have been found for NFTs in online retail, such as:\n\nDisposal of collectibles for sale\n\nPhysical Goods Before Their Release Date\n\nMetaverse-compatible digital copies\n\nExchangeable reward loyalty schemes\n\nAugmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and 3D AI\n\nA combination of AR, VR, and 3D AI allows the creation of fully realized digital recreations of physical environments. It is a virtual community where people can meet others, do business, and discover new things using their digital creations.\n\nThe Metaverse and similar technologies are well-suited to establishing user groups. Hence, people find it rewarding to purchase virtual things since they contribute to a feeling of community. In addition, online shoppers may get a feel for a product before purchasing by using these technologies.\n\nImpact of Web 3.0 On E-Commerce\n\nNow that you understand the elements of Web 3.0, let\u2019s better understand its impact on the world of e-commerce.\n\nThe Web will get more accessible.\n\nThe Web is transitioning to an open-source network, affecting websites and online stores. This implies that everyone may see the code, contribute to it, and build an inclusive community. This creates a more open and innovative group of consumers, merchants, and service providers.\n\nThe use of semantics will enhance the user experience.\n\nThe phrase \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d also pertains to the Semantic Web. It employs AI and machine learning to provide better customer service. Users will see more personalized content thanks to these technologies. E-commerce businesses can reach their target demographic with relevant content and attract more potential consumers to their sales funnels.\n\nAssets will be held by more people.\n\nThe crucial assets of online retailers will soon be transferable to their owners. Content assets might be anything from images and videos to testimonials and ratings. They may now be provided by the e-commerce platform, such as Shopify, being utilized. But, with Web 3.0, vendors will have full legal title to their online shop and associated assets.\n\nCustomized loyalty programs are the future.\n\nEvery online store may benefit from instituting a loyalty program since it will bring in more customers and increase word-of-mouth advertising. The distributed ledger technology (blockchain) capabilities introduced by Web 3.0 will automate and customize these applications for each user. The consumer\u2019s choices and previous purchases will be utilized to tailor the user\u2019s experience utilizing these tools.\n\nFinancial dealings will now have an extra layer of protection.\n\nBlockchain technology is inherently more secure than the current processes used by most sites. Consumers\u2019 digital footprints include a treasure trove of private information that may be easily stolen. With blockchain technology, this information is almost hack-proof. This safeguards the privacy of both the purchasers and the vendors.\n\nThe use of discretion will increase\n\nBlockchain technology promotes transparency at every stage of the business process. Because of this increased openness, there will be more trust on both sides of the transaction. Also, there will be a marked improvement in the transparency of communications between suppliers and merchants. Having everyone (suppliers, retailers, and customers) on the same page on what is and isn\u2019t covered by the brand\u2019s warranty policy is a huge benefit.\n\nThe integration of AR, VR, and voice control.\n\nTechnology like artificial intelligence and machine learning will improve the user interface. Technologies like augmented and virtual reality systems, voice-activated assistants, and related developments belong here. With these developments, customers may more readily determine their needs and make purchases.\n\nIn addition, they add fun to online shopping and help companies connect with their target markets on a deeper level. One way in which this change is already apparent is via the development of the Metaverse. Already, businesses are jostling for the best locations in the Metaverse\u2019s virtual economy.\n\nIndividualized product recommendations are in the future.\n\nOne of the benefits of shopping on Amazon is that the site\u2019s algorithm may suggest related products the customer may like. As Web 3.0 becomes widespread, more online stores can provide cross-selling to their clients and win over newcomers to turn into dedicated regulars. As blockchain will personalize loyalty programs, these recommendations will be made specifically for each customer based on their past purchases and interests. Customers who have made many successful purchases after receiving favorable recommendations are more likely to become brand loyal. Consumers who have developed an emotional connection to your brand are more inclined to purchase further.\n\nConclusion\n\nWeb 3.0 facilitates the rapid, secure, and transparent growth of businesses. Thus, more and more companies are hiring Web3 eCommerce development companies.\n\nUsing blockchain, cryptocurrency, metaverse technology solutions, and e-wallets, every customer could benefit from a one-of-a-kind and also a more thrilling purchasing experience. In addition, consumers may use the discounts they receive for future orders by earning loyalty points or other incentives. This will lead to greater financial success for companies.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Will this new AI chatbot replace Google?

        "description": "The Gaming industry in India is set for significant expansion as a result of Web 3.0\u2019s introduction. Decentralized applications (dApps) based on the blockchain will be a part of Web 3.0, the next generation of the internet. Blockchain technology offers several advantages, including immutability, transparency, and security.\n\nWeb3 is much of the time alluded to as an assortment of decentralized open-source applications that are interconnected and fueled by blockchain figuring design. The Metaverse, a similar open-source virtual reality environment, is not the same as it. Comprehending Web3 requires an understanding of its predecessors.\n\nThe Indian gaming market is expected to grow from $2.8 billion in 2022 to $5 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 28-30%. This growth is aided by the rise of online gaming platforms, affordable smartphones, and increasing internet usage. In addition, it is anticipated that the country\u2019s gaming population will grow from 420 million in 2022 to 450 million in 2023 and 500 million in 2025. The emergence of Web 3.0 has had a significant impact on this expansion and will continue to do so.\n\nUsing NFTs to Gamify:\n\nWeb 3.0 technology is transforming the gaming industry and offers game developers and players numerous advantages. One of the biggest benefits of Web 3.0 is that in-game assets can be purchased with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In comparison to conventional in-game assets, NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets that are secured by the blockchain and offer several advantages. NFTs, for example, give players true ownership of their in-game assets and can be traded on decentralized marketplaces. As a result, gamers and game developers can both benefit from this new revenue stream.\n\nGaming with NFTs is already taking off in India. Axie Endlessness, a game that utilizes NFTs and depends on the blockchain, has become an incredibly well-known cross country. The number of Indian players has increased, and some have even been able to make a living from it. Due to its phenomenal success, Axie Infinity has become the most downloaded Android and iOS game in India.\n\nGaming DeFi Powered by Blockchain:\n\nAnother advantage of Web 3.0 technology is that gaming can take advantage of decentralized finance (DeFi). The development of blockchain-based, decentralized financial applications is made possible by DeFi. Consequently, gamers now have a new means of earning money from gaming. A game developer might, for instance, create a DeFi protocol to reward players for completing particular in-game tasks. This new revenue stream for game developers allows players to make money playing their favorite games.\n\nIn India, the use of DeFi in gaming is additionally getting forward movement. My Neighbor Alice and The Sandbox, for instance, have previously implemented DeFi conventions in their games. It is anticipated that a greater number of gamers will use DeFi in games in the coming years, which may alter how gamers interact with games. Additionally, Web 3.0 may enable more widespread simplicity in gaming. A system that is both transparent and secure ensures that all transactions are recorded on a public ledger by utilizing blockchain technology. This may be beneficial for both the prevention of fraud and the fair treatment of players.\n\nWeb 3.0 technology is without a doubt providing the Indian gaming industry with a solid foundation for the future. Game developers and gamers can both earn money from gaming with the assistance of NFTs, DeFi, and blockchain technology. Developing a gaming system that is more transparent and secure can assist in preventing fraud and ensuring fair treatment of players. The Indian gaming industry will grow significantly thanks to Web 3.0 technology. Businesses in the sector ought to be prepared to adopt these new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.",

        "title": "5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 Business",
        "description": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe internet has undergone significant changes since its inception, and we are now on the verge of the next significant revolution in digital technology \u2014 Web 3.0. Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, is poised to revolutionize online interactions by providing a more secure, efficient and decentralized online experience. As entrepreneurs, it's essential to keep up with the times and adapt to this new environment to stay ahead of the competition. This article will explore some tips to help you build a successful Web 3.0 business.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips to Take Advantage of the Future Web 3.0 Decentralized Infrastructure\n\nLearn about Web 3.0\n\nTo start a Web 3.0 business, it's essential to understand the underlying technologies that make it possible. Web 3.0 is built on blockchain technology, a decentralized, distributed ledger that enables secure and transparent transactions. Additionally, Web 3.0 includes other emerging technologies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nTo begin your Web 3.0 journey, it's essential to immerse yourself in the community. By participating in online forums and social media platforms, you can engage with like-minded individuals, learn about the latest trends and stay up-to-date with developments in the Web 3.0 space. Reading industry publications such as CoinDesk, The Block and Decrypt can also be incredibly valuable. These resources can help you understand the challenges and opportunities of Web 3.0 and provide insights into the emerging use cases that are gaining traction.\n\nAs you learn more about Web 3.0, you'll discover that it's not just a technological revolution but a cultural and social movement as well. Web 3.0 is about putting control back into the hands of individuals, creating a more equitable and decentralized internet. By understanding the values and principles that underpin Web 3.0, you can build a business that aligns with these ideals and make a meaningful impact.\n\nHere are a few essential tips for starting a successful Web 3.0 venture:\n\n1. Choose a niche\n\nLike any business, choosing a niche for your Web 3.0 business is essential. The decentralized web is still in its infancy, with numerous opportunities for innovation and disruption. You can focus on a specific industry, such as gaming, finance or social media, or a particular use case, such as identity verification or supply chain management.\n\nWhen selecting a niche, it's essential to consider several factors. For instance, you should examine the potential market size, the competitive landscape and the regulatory framework. You should also consider the technical requirements of your chosen niche and ensure that you have the necessary skills and resources to build a successful Web 3 solution.\n\n2. Build a strong team\n\nTo thrive in Web 3.0, you'll need a talented team with diverse skills. Building a Web 3.0 business requires technical expertise in blockchain development, smart contract programming and decentralized application (dApp) design. However, having team members with expertise in business development, marketing and user experience design is also critical. When assembling your team, it's essential to seek out individuals passionate about Web 3.0 and share your vision for the future. It would be best if you also looked for team members open to learning and adapting to new technologies and comfortable working in a fast-paced, rapidly evolving environment.\n\nRelated: Entrepreneurs Should Embrace Web 3.0\n\n3. Focus on user experience\n\nWeb 3.0 technologies are still in their early stages, and many users need to become familiar with them. To succeed in Web 3.0, focusing on user experience and making your product as user-friendly as possible is crucial. One way to improve the user experience is to create intuitive user interfaces that are easy to navigate. You can also use gamification and other engagement strategies to incentivize users to engage with your product. Additionally, providing clear and concise instructions and tutorials is vital to help users understand how to use your product.\n\n4. Embrace decentralization\n\nOne of the defining features of Web 3.0 is decentralization, which allows for more secure and transparent interactions online. To succeed in Web 3.0, embracing decentralization and building your product with a decentralized architecture is essential.\n\n5. Stay up-to-date with regulations\n\nAs with any emerging industry, regulations for Web 3.0 are still in their early stages. It's crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest regulatory developments to ensure your Web 3.0 business complies with applicable laws and regulations. In some cases, regulatory requirements may differ significantly from traditional industries. For instance, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and token sales is still evolving and can vary widely by jurisdiction. As such, it's essential to consult with legal experts specializing in Web 3.0 and blockchain to ensure your business is on the right side of the law.\n\nIn conclusion, starting a successful Web 3.0 business requires a deep understanding of the underlying technologies, a strong team with diverse skills, a user-friendly product and an embrace of decentralization. By choosing a niche, staying up-to-date with regulations and focusing on user experience, you can set your Web 3.0 business up for success in this exciting new era of digital technology.\n\nRelated: Web 3.0, the Metaverse and the New Digital Economy \u2014 Are You Prepared?",

The event was themed, \"Is Web3 India's next big thing for a $5 trillion economy?\" and brought together over 250+ participants, including policymakers, industry experts, Web3 entrepreneurs, Web3 professionals, and Web2 professionals.\n\nThe event commenced with an insightful keynote address by Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, MP, Rajya Sabha, Chair, Parliamentary Standing Committees on Commerce, Eminent Jurist. He said, \u201cI stand here not as chair of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce but as one of a growing tribe of fellow Web3 enthusiasts who believe Web3 can be one of the biggest factors in bringing to fruition India's dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy.\u201d Dr. Singhvi went on to talk about how blockchain remains at the core of Web3.\n\n\n\nHe mentioned that Web3 envisions empowering its users in terms of controlling privacy, data, and ownership. He added that Web3 is a reaction to the centralised domination of a handful of tech giants in cyberspace.\n\nQuoting Elvin Tofler, Dr. Singhvi put emphasis on the importance of unlearning and how India needs to relearn about the growing Web3 industry. In this context he quoted, \u201cThe illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who can\u2019t read and write, but those who can't learn, unlearn, and re-learn.

        "title": "Sony Files for NFT Patent to Secure WEB 3.0 Gaming Future While Big Eyes Coin Unveils Secret Bonus Code",
        "description": "Sony is the first console maker to develop a Web 3.0 gaming framework for NFT assets. Could this be a sign that the NFT space is finally melting ice and investors should look at coins like Big Eyes Coin with big game plans?\n\nThe application, filed in September 2021 in the US and released this week, reveals Sony's plans to provide a standardized digital infrastructure enabling players to own and transfer digital NFT assets across various video game platforms. The Japanese company has been eager to take advantage of the expanding e-sports market since 2021 with various in-game digital collectibles.\n\nSony Aims to Make Assets More Interoperable\n\nWith the new move, Sony lays the groundwork for crypto gaming by enabling interoperable Web3 gameplay for users of Sony products, and the ability to move in-game items between virtual reality (VR) headsets, tablets, laptops, and smartphones will be available to gamers.\n\nThese tokenized gaming assets may include in-game artwork, avatars, weaponry, or even \"video game talents.\" The application also suggested that they might be \"linked across a network\" from PlayStation to consoles made by other companies and through VR and AR headsets, smart TVs, and mobile devices.\n\nSony's recent steps to increase visibility into the WEB3 and Metaverse gaming sphere by forming alliances and piloting early blockchain-based products signal the return of the NFT craze and its significance on WEB3.\n\nWhen there's an increasing NFT adoption trend across the cryptocurrency segment, investors should take note of new players with solid community ties who are currently in the presale. Big Eyes Coin is a newcomer in the meme coin space that recently had its first presale of the year.\n\nBig Eyes Coin - A Cat You Should Hold Onto\n\nSince late 2022, the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) presale has been going strong and has broken Ethereum's presale record. It is expected to break even more records once the coin launches and has raised over 33 million. The token has changed how meme coins are perceived in the cryptocurrency market, dispelling the myth that they are only helpful in making joke-based entertainment.\n\nGiven its momentum, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) aims to enter the NFT market with a bang. Users can make unique tokens out of any digital asset when the developers launch Sushi Crew, the NFT marketplace for the Big Eyes Coin platform. To relieve customers of having to pay the hefty gas costs associated with Ethereum, Sushi Crew will also offer free NFT transactions.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Sushi Club\n\nIs Big Eyes Coin Sushi Club the New NFT Haven?\n\nThe Big Eyes Coin Sushi Crew is a sushi cub for NFT holders who want to have fun and collect precious objects. Members of the NFT sushi crew can purchase and exchange cat-themed NFTs for making money. The Big Eyes Coin is ideal for long-term investors because the currency's value rises over time, as seen in the presale.\n\nAlthough the crypto itself will not be subject to a tax, the system's NFTs will be subject to one of 10%; of that amount, 4% will go to the original seller, 5% to BIG holders in general, and 1% will be set aside for charity.\n\nBig Eyes Coin presale revenue is $33 million. In connection with its presale, BIG started a loot box marketing campaign. The most recent loot box vault pin is the largest reward, which grants three Excali-Paw Master Chests. Users can purchase the box for $100,000, and the maximum reward is $1 million per box. Recently, the coin also launched a 250% bonus for early adopters of the coin, which is likely to end after the presale season. Investors can use BULLRUN250 to claim extra BIG tokens.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nBig Eyes Coin holds grand plans for its future. It aims to democratize De-Fi and push NFT adoption with its cute cat mascot. The arrival of gaming giants like Sony marks the revival of the NFT and WEB3 economies, and investors are likely to see huge price hikes in coins associated with these industries.\n\nOverall, integrating NFTs in gaming can transform the gaming industry, providing new opportunities for gamers and Gaming dApps alike. It remains to be seen how this will play out, but it is clear that NFTs are poised to play a significant role in the future of gaming.\n\nFor more information on Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin",

        "description": "The adoption of Web 3.0 technologies has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, including finance, OTT, education, banking, supply chain, real estate, and arts and fashion. Here are some potential changes that these industries could undergo:\n\nFinance: With Web 3.0 technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, traditional financial institutions could face competition from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that enable peer-to-peer lending, staking, and other financial services. Decentralized platforms could facilitate secure and private sharing of financial data among individuals and institutions, while enabling more transparent and efficient management of assets.\n\nOTT: Over-the-top (OTT) platforms could use Web 3.0 technologies to create more direct and decentralized connections between content creators and audiences. Decentralized content distribution platforms could enable content creators to distribute and monetize their content without relying on centralized intermediaries. Smart contracts could also facilitate revenue sharing and other forms of compensation between content creators and their audience.\n\nEducation: Web 3.0 technologies could enable more direct and efficient connections between learners and educators. Decentralized education platforms could enable peer-to-peer learning and credentialing, as well as more secure and private sharing of student data. Smart contracts could also facilitate more transparent and efficient management of academic credentials.\n\nBanking: With Web 3.0 technologies, traditional banks could face competition from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that enable peer-to-peer lending, staking, and other financial services. Decentralized platforms could facilitate more secure and private sharing of financial data among individuals and institutions, while enabling more transparent and efficient management of assets.\n\nSupply Chain: Web 3.0 technologies could enable more transparent and efficient management of supply chains. Blockchain-based supply chain solutions could enable greater traceability and accountability in the movement of goods, while also reducing fraud and counterfeiting. Smart contracts could also facilitate more direct and efficient interactions between buyers and suppliers.\n\nReal Estate: Web 3.0 technologies could enable more direct and efficient interactions between buyers and sellers of real estate. Decentralized platforms could facilitate secure and transparent management of real estate transactions, as well as more secure and transparent storage of property data. Smart contracts could also facilitate more efficient management of real estate contracts and agreements.\n\nArts and Fashion: With Web 3.0 technologies, artists and fashion designers could use decentralized platforms to create and distribute their work more directly to their audience. Decentralized content distribution platforms could enable artists to distribute and monetize their work without relying on centralized intermediaries, while smart contracts could facilitate more transparent and efficient management of royalties and other forms of compensation.\n\nFrom virtual art galleries and fashion shows to digital clothing and avatar customization, creatives are leveraging Metaverse technologies to showcase their works and engage with audiences in innovative ways. The Metaverse is opening up new horizons for arts and fashion, offering exciting opportunities for self-expression and creative collaboration in this digital age.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are just a few examples of how Web 3.0 technologies could transform these industries, and the specific changes will depend on a variety of factors however the adoption of Web 3.0 technologies is definitely promising for the future of all the above industries.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",

        "title": "Web 3.0 Revolution and the Modern Job Market: Top 10 Non-Tech Jobs",
        "description": "By Rituparna Chakraborty, Executive Director and Co-Founder, TeamLease Services\n\nThe foundation of Web 3.0 is built around the fundamental ideas of decentralisation, openness, and increased consumer usefulness. As this technology is all set to disrupt the world, is it time for tech-illiterate people to hang up their gloves and reconcile to a world of irrelevance and unemployment?\n\nIT spending in India is expected to be over $100 billion this year. Web 3.0 with its reliance on automation definitely heralds the coronation of technology as the critical differentiator. However, this does not announce an end-of-the-road scenario for non-tech expertise. Hiring managers are proactively seeking people with broad capabilities beyond technical skills. There is a rapidly growing demand to hire a supporting cast of performers who can take the main cast, namely technology products, to market and ensure their growth and survival. Companies need to utilise the skills of non-tech professionals and adopt a balanced talent strategy where equal weightage is given to a wider set of capabilities such as creativity, collaboration, and management. Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most sought-after roles in Web3.\n\n1. Business Analyst: As per a study conducted by Team Lease, \u2018Brain Drain: Tackling the Great Talent Exodus\u2019 an estimated 2.7 million jobs are expected to open up for this profile by the end of 2022. There are numerous opportunities for analysts in the web3 space as businesses hire different kinds of analysts such as data analysts, financial analysts or business analysts depending on specific requirements and projects. These analysts essentially help to evaluate trends, implement competitive bench-marking and develop strategies driven towards business growth and risk mitigation.\n\n2. Beta Tester: Web3 projects revolve around using and delivering cutting-edge technology. Therefore, it is necessary to run a quality check on applications before offering them to the public. Beta testers can expect to receive bonuses, rewards, or upgrades in addition to a salary as they get involved in developing products and honing their skills as a beta tester.\n\n3. Chief of Staff: The job of a Chief of Staff traditionally has been to ensure seamless productivity across the organisation. The same applies to the world of Web3 where there is a need for a single point of contact or gatekeeper who can work closely with different business units and management to ensure everyone remains on the same page. The role requires maturity to provide guidance and oversight for projects of high importance.\n\n4. Community Manager: This is perhaps one of the pivotal roles in web3 as it involves building a community of users and interacting with them to cultivate a diverse consumer base. Community managers must have a proficient understanding of the crypto world to be able to promote new NFTs.\n\n5. Content curators and Content Writers: These roles are as intrinsic to web3 as they have been to previous iterations of the web. This important role involves around establishing the voice of the company through thought leadership. It also involves creating content to explain and market products to the public. Technical writing skills are also required to explain products and procedures. As the goal of web3 is to provide targeted content to each individual user, the role of content curators and content writers is set to grow manyfold.\n\n6. Designers: A web3 designer role is a great option for people with a creative bent of mind with the conviction that well-designed software and content lie at the core of creating a successful business. Designers can begin to add value to the work by brainstorming ideas and helping to develop strategies even with limited tech experience. Creativity is the key that can then be augmented with technological skills that can be learned over time.\n\n7. Events Manager: Businesses need to connect with customers and stakeholders; thus, creating such opportunities to converge and connect is essential. Event managers play a key role in organizing IRL (in real life) events to improve business visibility in the age of web3. A good understanding of decentralised Internet, crypto, and blockchain can go a long way in building this career path.\n\n8. Influencer Manager: Web3 companies too require social media influencers to promote their projects and products. However, an influencer manager is required to develop and manage marketing plans that are in line with the growth trajectory of the business. One needs to cultivate relationships with several influencers across different platforms.\n\n9. Sales and Marketing: Businesses in the Web3 arena are at par with traditional brick and mortar as well as .com businesses in requiring sales and marketing professionals to grow and flourish. Innovative sales techniques are more sought after than technical expertise for these roles.\n\n10. Talent Acquisition Manager: This is perhaps the most important role for the success of web3 businesses as it involves bridging the gap between the employer and the employee. The key areas of focus in this role revolve around conducting full lifecycle recruitment, cultivating employer brand awareness, and creating exceptional teams across different verticals within the organisation.\n\nAs the world gradually transitions into Web 3.0 using technologies such as machine learning and AI, it seeks to create a more decentralised and secure network. It relies on blockchain and cryptocurrency to protect and exchange user data thus making the internet more secure, proficient, and democratic. The goal is to provide relevant content for each user instead of just content that other end-users have provided. This technology-driven universe needs to be nurtured and serviced by people with tech and non-tech skills. In the words of Henry Ford, \u201ccoming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success.\u201d",

        "title": "The future of Web 3.0 and crypto in India augmented by the digital rupee",
        "description": "The global crypto ecosystem has grown tremendously in the past three years. More than 200 million users are estimated to have an exposure in the asset class. About 10% of this userbase is from India. Despite regulatory uncertainties, Indian investors have shown significant interest in the space. Many Web 3.0-based businesses have also started offering services that cater to the global ecosystem. Today, we envision a role that Web 3.0 and crypto services can play in India and how we must prepare for this.The crypto asset class has potential to give disproportionate returns to investors over time in a democratic way. This has not been the case with any other technology-based asset in the past. For example, a US citizen had earlier access to global IT stocks in 2000s before Indians did.It is now up to the Indian government to encourage this ecosystem in a compliant manner. The government has taken great strides already. Be it a TDS on sales or the recent anti-money laundering (AML) provisions under PMLA, the messaging from the government has been consistent: invest fairly and declare the profits.However, India-based exchanges, which have been the most compliant, have experienced a significant drop in volumes since July 2022 as investors migrated to using non-compliant global exchanges for their trades. This must be addressed quickly.Indian businesses that operate with local offices are best suited to be the partner of choice for the government and the \u2018platform of trust\u2019 for the investors. Given that services offered by Indian platforms are on par with global exchanges in terms of products and ease of use, they must be actively encouraged.Blockchain, the core technology behind crypto and Web 3.0, is already implemented across industries and is touted as the base of the next big Metaverse trend.In this context, crypto and Web 3.0 services originating from Indian businesses can serve a multitude of use cases globally. India will no longer have to be an offshore-based economy but a leader of an industry.The benefits of these are plenty. 1) This will attract foreign investments into India and 2) the sector will create new jobs that will serve the economy and the youth well.This needs a consistent approach in terms of education and in incentivizing businesses. We must prepare our youth for this 5-10 years ahead.Another key benefit of crypto is the ability to enhance payments infrastructure in terms of time and cost. Cross-border payments via crypto have already given a boost to some countries. Bitcoin, the beacon of crypto asset class, has been at the forefront of this change over the years. Now, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are being regarded as a means for governments to enter the ecosystem and gain visibility.India\u2019s retail CBDC (CBDC-R) started its pilot stage in December 2022 with around 50,000 retail participants across four cities: Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore, and Bhubaneswar. Users can transact with eRupee through a digital wallet offered by the participating banks which are stored mobile phones. So far, more than INR 7-lakh-worth of transactions have been facilitated in the retail pilot.The eRupee is expected to have several benefits, including faster and cheaper transactions, improved financial inclusion, and reduced reliance on cash. It is also expected to make it easier for the government to track transactions and crack down on money laundering.The eRupee can naturally become the de facto onramp for crypto and Web 3.0 transactions \u2013 i.e. investors can transact with crypto and NFTs only via eRupee. This can also be extended to sectors such as online gaming. With the rise of blockchain technology, we expect the e-Rupee to be integrated into decentralized applications, making it an integral part of the Web 3.0 ecosystem in the future.While blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new and complex technology that requires significant expertise to navigate. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to understand and use digital assets effectively. Consumer awareness and educational programs in various languages can slowly bridge this gap.The inherent volatility in crypto asset prices needs proper risk planning by individuals and companies. While we anticipate the asset class to mature over time and decline in volatility, it is still years away.The adoption and success of the eRupee is dependent on its use cases and regulatory clarity that accompanies its usage. The move towards transparency will keep the ecosystem clean and trustable.The future remains bright for the crypto and Web 3.0 ecosystem in India with right interventions. We must act, soon.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "description": "The Indian Web 3.0 market will expand from $0.0049 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2032 at a compound annualised growth rate (CAGR) of 57 per cent, according to a white paper presented at the Entrepreneur Web 3.0 Summit in Bengaluru.\n\nThe market for metaverse in India is currently valued at $2.4 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 39.2 per cent to $33.9 billion by 2030.\n\nBlockchain market value is anticipated to grow from $0.28 billion in 2019 to $4.3 billion by 2025, with a CAGR of 47.3 per cent. The non-fungible token (NFT) industry has also been expanding, and according to the study, it will reach $8.6 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 22.82 per cent, up from $2.46 billion in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn India, the market size of NFT is expected to record a CAGR of 61.6 per cent, increasing from $3.3 billion in 2021 to reach $27 billion by 2028,\u201d the report said.\n\nUS IRS Comes Out With Final Rules On Taxation Of NFT Assets\n\nNFT holders are on edge after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) declared that it has reached its final rules regarding taxation of NFT assets.\n\nThe IRS document states that the main suggestion is to consider NFTs the same way as collectibles like fine wine, art, or stamps. The IRS disclosed that NFTs would be taxed similarly to the underlying assets they indicate the digital ownership of as part of a public request for feedback on the upcoming plan for finalised NFT tax rules.\n\nFor instance, if you purchased an Australian opal NFT from the forthcoming Pixelplex Opalverse store, you would be subject to the same taxation as if you had purchased (and paid for) the actual Australian opal.\n\n\u201cThe IRS intends to determine when an NFT is treated as a collectible by using a \u2018look-through analyses,\u201d IRS said in its publication.\n\nFrom Concerts To Jet Ski Tours, Celebrities Rake In Money In Metaverse\n\nOnline gaming platform Roblox features an island named Paris World that was created by reality TV star and Hilton family heiress Paris Hilton. Visitors can take jet-ski tours around the island, stroll along a boardwalk, and view a digital recreation of her Beverly Hills estate, replete with a dog mansion. Of course, the game\u2019s currency, Robux, must be spent in order to engage in any of these pursuits.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg is also rebuilding his mansion in the sandbox metaverse platform where he has held various concerts. Called \u201csnoopverse\u201d, it is an expansion of his digital world, which includes tickets to private parties and Q&A sessions. Some of these private passes are going for close to $6,000, according to Fortune.\n\nShawn Mendes is currently creating digital wearables in collaboration with the avatar technology company Genie, which is generating waves in the metaverse.\n\nFor Beat Saber, a virtual reality (VR) rhythm game set in the metaverse, Lady Gaga published a music pack. Players can also \u201cslash\u201d rhythms that are flying towards them while wearing VR glasses. Other well-known artists, including Green Day and Imagine Dragons, have also contributed songs to the well-known game.",

        "title": "Metaverse, Web 3.0 and NFTs: What marketers need to know",
        "description": "Recently a student of mine at the University of Oregon introduced me to a digital clothing app that allows users to house a \u201cdigital closet.\u201d Curious as to what value it provides, I downloaded the app and began to experiment. At first glance, it looked like a Snapchat lens, where you can overlay virtual clothing, jewelry, hats and other fashion accessories over your image via your mobile phone\u2019s camera.\n\nThe app charged a fee for users to upload a photo of themselves that would then be altered to include the digital fashion item so that they could post it on their social media. This is worthless to me \u2014 as I can easily alter an image of myself or snap a photo through an AR lens. Most social apps these days offer similar capabilities.\n\nHowever, after more exploring, this digital closet app also sold the idea of being able to wear these digital fashions on virtual dates and in virtual meetings. In my view, this is how I envision a truly digital closet \u2014 one you can wear virtually, wherever you are. To get this capability, you needed to purchase an NFT.\n\nExcited by the idea of wearing a digital, pink feather boa during my next online class, I eagerly attempted to buy a cool NFT. After an investment of several hours and dollars, I\u2019m still unable to wear my digital fashion in a Zoom meeting. This capability doesn\u2019t even exist. So, what gives?\n\nNFTs just aren\u2019t there yet\n\nLet this story be a cautionary tale. Without the right strategy, you will annoy your audience and might never win them back. There have been many headlines announcing the failure of NFT drops, Porsche being one of the latest casualties. (Yes, Porsche!) This is just the start of NFT woes.\n\nA recent court ruling has suggested that NFTs are securities and need to be treated as such, with oversight by the SEC. This same court ruling now holds the brand responsible for violations resulting from their attempt to reduce friction in purchasing the NFT and provide a better user experience.\n\nWhile NFTs may be risky for marketers, the metaverse can still offer brands opportunities to engage their audiences, share digital goods, and build community. And if there\u2019s just one thing I want you to take away from this article, it\u2019s that NFTs, the metaverse and Web 3.0 aren\u2019t the same.\n\nDig deeper: What is the metaverse and how can we get there?\n\nMetaverse, Web 3.0 and NFTs aren\u2019t the same things\n\nIf they aren\u2019t the same thing, how are they related? Why do the media, agencies and industry experts keep bundling them together?\n\nThese terms are often intermingled because of a lack of historical perspective and the belief that all digital goods ownership begins and ends with an NFT. This isn\u2019t the case. You can own a digital item, digital land in the metaverse and not get anywhere near an NFT or the blockchain. Let me try and offer simple definitions of these terms through a marketing lens.\n\nIf you are old like me, you remember the promise of Web 2.0 and the excitement around turning passive internet users into active creators. Tools like WordPress, YouTube Studio and others allowed anyone to create web content. Social platforms allowed communities to come together like never before and offered a framework for those communities to share product reviews and recommendations.\n\nSmart marketers were not only excited about these innovative technologies but quick to adopt them themselves and begin exploring their new capabilities. I see Web 3.0 in the same way.\n\nThe promise of Web 3.0\n\nThe common definition of Web 3.0 (or Web3) often includes technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, I choose to define Web 3.0 more broadly. The future of the internet is spatial and I see Web 3.0 as referring to this new 3D version of the internet.\n\nImmersive spaces aren\u2019t reliant on the blockchain or cryptocurrency and it\u2019s misleading to suggest otherwise. I also feel that a component of Web 3.0 is moving users from creating 2D elements such as images and videos to creating 3D content.\n\nWhether this 3D content lives on a decentralized network is yet to be determined. To recap, Web 3.0 is a broad term referring to the future of the web as being spatial, which may or may not include emerging technologies such as NFTs, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nMetaverse or virtual world?\n\nThe metaverse commonly refers to virtual spaces where users will spend time. Here, the promise of Web 3.0 will come to life and provide the infrastructure and framework to support these interoperable and immersive spaces. I believe the metaverse exists, yet it\u2019s an aspirational vision of what we can achieve in the future. We all have a role to play in shaping it. You can read my take on how we get there in my Manifesto for the makers of the metaverse.\n\nToday, we have a network of private clubs or walled gardens (I would call \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d). They have different languages, rules and currencies, making navigating from one community to another difficult.\n\nThis also challenges brands looking to build a community in one of these immersive spaces. In the same way you carefully choose where to place your media spend to reach your target audience (i.e., CIO.com, Wall Street Journal, CNN, USA Today, etc.), you need to hunt down your audience across these virtual worlds.\n\nYou can identify the right platform with the help of this report, which shows the size, demographics and technology behind all the major virtual worlds, including Roblox, Second Life, Decentraland, The Sandbox and hundreds of others.\n\nDigital ownership is not new\n\nSo now that we have a working definition of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse, how do NFTs fit into this mix of emerging tech?\n\nA non-fungible token (or NFT) is defined by Merriam-Webster as \u201ca unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, that is recorded in a blockchain and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership.\u201d If we remove the bit about blockchain, then the virtual world of Second Life has been offering NFTs for over a decade.\n\nSecond Life was forced to solve the issue of digital ownership back in 2006 as content creators on that platform were selling their virtual goods. Initially, the Second Life platform didn\u2019t have a framework to prevent users from copying virtual items such as clothing, skins, furniture and buildings. The creators of this content couldn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d their creations. The developers quickly created a system of permissions that allowed a content creator to designate if the item could be copied or transferred to another user.\n\nIf the creator wanted to make a one-of-a-kind thing, they could. But it was more common to sell multiple versions of the item that were non-transferrable, more like buying an item of clothing off the rack. I could only wear that item if I purchased it from its creator. This system allowed many Second Life designers to earn significant dollars in real life, with the virtual world\u2019s first millionaire, Anshe Chung, being announced during that time.\n\nDoes it solve an actual problem?\n\nOne of my major problems with NFTs is that I don\u2019t see the problem they solve. You can create digital ownership without NFTs. Their value is positioned as allowing for true ownership of a digital good through a decentralized platform instead of relying on infrastructure provided by a big tech company. And this may be true, but right now, that benefit is exactly what makes them risky and difficult for consumers to engage with.\n\nI have had a digital closet in Second Life since 2006, and I still \u201cown\u201d every item in that closet. I can even wear them today on the platform. This is an amazing statement, given the shifting landscape of the metaverse and immersive worlds over the last 20 years. I predict that NFTs, as we know them today, will go away and this technology will morph into something truly valuable \u2014 but not for years to come.\n\nWhat\u2019s in store for the metaverse, Web 3.0 and NFTs?\n\nThe promise for the metaverse, Web 3.0 and NFTs is a world where I can wear every item in my digital closet anywhere. The promise includes immersive spaces for work, for play and even for navigating around the real world with the use of AR eyewear \u2014 and a persistent and interoperable digital layer that interacts with real-world and virtual worlds. This vision will become a reality. We\u2019re just not quite there yet.",

        "description": "Ad:Tech 2023: The leverage point of Web 3.0 is decentralisation\n\nAt the conference, a panel discussed the opportunities of Web 3.0 and how it can scale personalisation for brands\n\nFrom left: Bharat Khatri, Abhishek Biswal,Prabhakar Tiwari, Pankaj Sharma and Prabhakar Tiwari\n\nOn day one of the Ad: Tech 2023 conference, Anil Pandit, senior vice president, lead - precision (programmatic), India, Publicis Media; Prabhakar Tiwari, chief growth officer, AngelOne; Pankaj Sharma, CEO and director, Mgid and Abhishek Biswal, business head, Airtel ads, spoke about the strong suits of Web 3.0 and how brands can provide a layer of personalisation through decentralisation offerings.\n\nThe session was moderated by Bharat Khatri, chief digital officer, APAC, Omnicom MediaGroup.\n\nDecentralisation is an important pillar of Web 3.0\n\nA decentralised network is an independently run server that is not controlled by a business.\n\nStating why decentralisation is a key pillar of Web 3.0, Tiwari said, \u201cThe biggest advantage of Web 3.0 is decentralisation. For instance, it means a lot for fin-tech concerning payments in business and loan sanctioning It will be able to tap into cohorts through data available on network platforms.\u201d\n\nHowever, to see the profitability of Web 3.0, Tiwari opined those big tech companies will have to be sidelined because they can leverage all the customer data available and monetise it.\n\n\u201cDecentralisation is the way forward and big tech companies can put a dent in its opportunities. If a consumer is not paying for a certain service, they are paying for it with their time and attention. These cohorted data can be utilised to create personalised solutions only if there\u2019s a decentralised data network\u201d, shared Tiwari.\n\nDecentralisation requires connectivity\n\nBiswal stated, \u201cToday all of us use the internet through various devices. We are connected to the internet through a SIM card or wifi. This is the only way consumers can be a part of the decentralised community. The bedrock of the decentralisation community will be built on connectivity. Essentially the availability of data will be multifold with offerings such as 4G and 5G connectivity. It will give rise for every website and content creator to give its viewers an enriched experience.\u201d\n\nBiswal remarked that with Web 3.0, brands will be able to be much closer to the customer than before. Sharing an example, he said, \u201cIf everyone in UP likes a niche content piece, an entertainment platform can keep that content specifically for that area instead of keeping it on a digital cloud that is working out of Mumbai. It will reduce the buffering of that content as only a cohorted audience will be watching and the customer will get a seamless experience.\u201d\n\nData scales personalisation\n\nSharma giving his take on how personalisation will receive a push with Web 3.0 said, \u201cData is a crucial pillar for Web 3.0. It can provide a consumer with personalised content and recommendations. However, earlier this data was only accessible to a few who store the data with their network and targeted ads based on that data to the consumer. With a decentralised network, most of the data will be stored on the blockchain and controlled by the user. It won\u2019t be controlled by a third-party app. Hence consumer data will be accessible to all brands and service providers which will enable them to offer targeted solutions.\u201d\n\nThe brand fit for Web 3.0\n\nPandit remarked that we have already dipped our toes in this decentralised ecosystem and tested bits and pieces of the metaverse.\n\nSharing how he views decentralised networks from an agency perspective, he expressed, \u201cBrands can engage with their consumers through the metaverse and create an experience for them by using their virtual assets. However, we are still at the tip of the iceberg. For now, we need to explore the Web 3.0 ecosystem and keep data privacy at the core while executing offerings.\u201d",

Bush and Barack Obama administrations had \u201creally made a big mess\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cA lot of the traditional people we were working with were saying, \u2018let\u2019s go to Canada or Mexico and kiss a baby,\u2019 and do some, you know, worthless thing,\u201d Kushner said.\n\nDuring that visit, Trump visited Saudi Arabia, and Kushner told the conference how impressed he was with the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, launched under King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe Saudi leadership was as keen as the US administration at the time to focus on shared ambitions and goals, rather than any differences, he said.\n\nKushner added he could see that the king and crown prince were fully focused on making \u201cbig transformations\u201d in the Kingdom, but \u201ctraditionalist\u201d policy-planning officials in the US told him the changes would not come to fruition.\n\n\u201cAnd me having no (political) experience, if somebody\u2019s telling you they want to change, and if we agree with the change, let\u2019s give them a shot to try to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we worked very hard on the trip, and the deliverables from it were truly historic.\u201d\n\nAside from important economic and security deals signed during the visit to Saudi Arabia, the opening of a center to combat extremism in the country was an outcome of which Kushner is particularly proud.\n\nHe highlighted the counterterror financing center, which gave access to US officials to the Middle East\u2019s banking system and allowed the partners to \u201creally fight money that was going to bad actors.\u201d",

        "title": "Five things you need to know about\u2026 investing in Web 3.0",
        "description": "White & Case Tech Newsflash\n\nDespite the recent market turbulence for cryptocurrencies and associated high profile scandals, investment in Web 3.0 assets continues as investors look to take advantage of depressed valuations and corporations continue to develop their Web 3.0 & Metaverse strategies in order to protect their brands, IP rights and business lines in this new, shared virtual environment.\n\nWe are seeing an increasing number of investors interested in acquiring rights and assets in the Web 3.0 space. In addition, as more companies become exposed to Web 3.0 as an incidental part of their main business, this is likely to become another class of assets to be dealt with as part of the M&A process.\n\nWe have identified five issues to think about when investing into Web 3.0 opportunities.\n\nOne\n\nThe old rules don't apply\n\nCorporate control of the Web 3.0 projects can be a challenging concept. Unlike traditional businesses with boards of directors and clear governance structures, Web 3.0 projects are often (to a greater or lesser extent) decentralised and autonomous organisations that aim to provide underlying users with a sense of ownership and a role in decision making (weighted based on token holdings). As there is (deliberately) rarely a controlling token holder, investors should be aware that governance rights of the underlying projects (including those of the founding organisation that an investor may be backing) can be limited and the future direction of the project itself may be driven by the collective user base.\n\nRelated to this, the very nature of blockchain technology means that none of the conventional ownership and proof of title rules apply around things like state-run public registries, physical ownership of certificates of title, company books and records or evidence of transfers of title. Instead, it is necessary to dig into the underlying technology and see who or what is actually on the ledger (and respective stake sizes).\n\nIn addition, as much of the potential return associated with Web 3.0 projects will likely be through appreciation of underlying tokens, investors backing projects may consider negotiating upside by acquiring rights to subscribe for future tokens at a discount (rather than, or in addition to, traditional equity-linked protections in the founding organisation itself).\n\nTwo\n\nActually, some of the old rules do still apply\n\nWhilst the underlying Web 3.0 projects themselves may be decentralised and \"on chain\", many of the key players involved in these projects (including the founding organisations and early stage investors) have traditional corporate structures and investing in these entities will present many of the same legal issues affecting other types of businesses and these will also need to be addressed as part of the investment process. Examples of this will include corporate holding structures, employees, contracts with suppliers, banking and financing arrangements and so on. All of this will still need to be diligenced and usually warranted as part of the process.\n\nMany Web 3.0 businesses and especially those involved in trading crypto currencies and other crypto assets, as well as many web-based gaming businesses, may be subject to varying degrees of regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are based and/or operate, but regulation is still playing catch-up in this space. Depending on the jurisdiction, the present regulatory position is often not clear-cut and will need to be analyzed in line with any future regulatory changes envisaged by governments and regulatory bodies. Regulators are taking an increasingly hawkish approach towards things like advertising, promotions and celebrity endorsements. Rules around data handling and data privacy will also need to be complied with.\n\nThree\n\nKnow Your Customer\n\nA major challenge for investors is to satisfy laws and regulations around KYC, anti-money laundering and sanctions when investing in an asset class designed to promote anonymity and decentralization. It may not necessarily be clear and transparent as to whom you are dealing with and who actually owns the assets in question. This is further complicated when money needs to change hands and banking payments need to be made on closing a deal. There is also the issue of reputational risk and the danger of inadvertently transacting with undesirable counter-parties. In light of these risks, investors should engage advisers experienced in diligencing Web 3.0 and blockchain assets.\n\nFour\n\nValuation and Exit\n\nObtaining conventional valuations of Web 3.0 assets is a challenge and this, in turn, makes it more difficult to obtain conventional acquisition financing for most transactions. The issues around deducing title and ownership and the unconventional nature of the assets involved also makes obtaining effective security another issue to be tackled.\n\nThe exit process for investors can also be very different to traditional investments. In general, tokens associated with a Web 3.0 project can be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges much earlier than a traditional business would seek a public offering. However, investors will often be subject to very lengthy lock-ups (up to three years in some cases, as compared to the traditional IPO lock-up of 90-180 days). Understanding and negotiating a clear path to liquidity will be essential for any investor.\n\nFive\n\nEnforcement\n\nA key consideration on any transaction is the governing law of the relevant acquisition/investment agreement and the jurisdiction or forum for any dispute resolution. This is normally most relevant to any claims under the agreement, for example for an indemnity or breach of warranty and their eventual effective enforcement through the courts against the breaching party. In a world where everything exists somewhere in the cloud, these issues only multiply and need to be properly considered and structured early on, so that you are not left high and dry chasing a virtual counterparty.",

        "title": "Web 3.0 died last week",
        "description": "The promise of Web 3.0 was decentralization. The idea was to take power away from banks and big tech and put it on the blockchain, tokenize it or let people control it themselves in some other way --a more-democratic internet.\n\nIt was a powerful idea that attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment. The results so far have fallen far short of they hype. The use cases of crypto have been limited, NFTs are a joke and scams are rampant.\n\nThe Web 3.0 hype along with ultra-low interest rates kicked off a Web 1.0-style dot-com bubble. For months, every press release referred to blockchain, crypto or some other kind of revolutionary way of doing things that aren't particularly hard to do today.\n\nTwo major conduits for the flow of money from investors into Web 3.0 were Silvergate Bank for crypto and Silicon Valley Bank for tech startups. Both banks failed this week and I can't help but think of that as the tombstone for an era.\n\nThat certainly doesn't mean the end of crypto, defi or tech venture capital but it's a sign of which way the wind is blowing. These are all expensive projects and the money is gone. It took a decade for tech to recover from the dot-com bust and this will be no different.\n\nThat's not to say bitcoin prices will crash. Bitcoin has separated itself from many of the rug pulls and scams. It's been volatile but functional but beyond that it's a short list. Who would want to invest in a space where money isn't flowing and regulators are cracking down.\n\nIn tech, it's now widely recognized as a bubble and venture capital investors no longer have an off-ramp into capital markets. Moreover, cheap borrowing rates are done. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank will mean that companies can't make payroll text week and, presumably, will be laying off workers in short order. There were $200 billion in deposits held there and only accounts up to $250,000 were insured. In the company's last 10K it said that uninsured deposits were $151.5 billion. Much -- hopefully all -- of that money will be recovered but it will take time to sell the corresponding assets.\n\nIt's the kind of mess that will slowly starve the industry of capital.\n\nIn summary, we all knew there were bubbles in crypto and tech venture capital. The poetry of the two flagship banks in those areas failing in the same week\n\nFrom the ashes\n\nThe good news is that Web 4.0 is already here.\n\nArtificial intelligence is capturing imaginations and delivering incredible results. Much of the remaining money in Web 3.0 is quickly pivoting to AI and while some of that is the usual theme-chasing, there will be results.\n\nIt's a good thing too because that's a lifeline for technology more broadly and will transform the world before the decade is done.",

According to the partnership details as contained in a Press Release shared with Coinspeaker, Wakweli will extend its Non-Fungible Token (NFT) certification technology to Polygon for the benefit of all projects resident on the protocol.\n\nWakweli is gaining momentum as an essential outfit that helps to restore trust in the digital collectible world. The startup\u2019s primary business model involves issuing Certificates of Authenticity for NFTs and other tokenized assets to fight fraud and generally contribute to the growth and evolution of the broader Web 3.0 ecosystem.\n\nThe partnership with Polygon will enable Wakweli to expand its reach and significantly diversify its ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSince 2021 when ETH fees skyrocketed, Polygon established itself as the go-to chain to mint assets and has performed extremely well ever since \u2013 it is now the home of incredible NFT projects,\u201d said Antoine Sarraute, Co-Founder of Wakweli, adding that the team \u201c..built Wakweli to create a safer web3 space across all chains, and today we are thrilled to collaborate with Polygon. This will enable Wakweli\u2019s certification power to all Polygon users and unlock a definitive way to fight scam attempts, creating more trust in this thriving ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThrough Wakweli, projects with tokenized assets on Polygon can request authentication for all of their assets.\n\nPolygon is currently a growing hub for digital collectibles as it brandished a more scalable, sustainable, and cheaper ecosystem when compared to Ethereum. Based on its high technological capability, Polygon is now being embraced by many mainstream companies chief amongst whom is the American coffeehouse chain Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX).\n\nStarbucks built its Odyssey NFT project on Polygon and in an extended collaboration, Wakweli will be in a position to certify the authenticity of these assets for users.\n\nWakweli to Offer Enhanced Use Cases\n\nBesides its basic offerings, Wakweli is also bound to offer other advanced utilities or use cases that can add extra value to all Polygon users who adopt its solution.\n\nFor instance, project owners can access the Wakweli API or request automatic certification requests for NFTs just as collectors mint them. This automatic certification will enhance the security push of these collectibles as it will leave no room for cybercriminals to create a fake version of the assets.\n\nWakweli also noted that it will be available to work with developers to create a tailored solution should they have any specific certification feature they hope to introduce into their project. In addition, with the Polygon collaboration, users can take advantage of the incentive Wakweli offers its users when they request certificate reviews.\n\nThis feature is powered by the unique Proof-of-Democracy (PoD) and generally contributes to the authenticity of the protocol is marketing.

        "title": "Vassar to embrace Web 3.0, transition to crypto \u2013 The Miscellany News",
        "description": "Your college experience is about to get a lot more futuristic. On Monday, Feb. 27, Dean Gus D. Weebuloid\u2014newly-hired chair of Vassar Advanced Payments and Educational Reorientation Services(VAPERS)\u2014announced that Vassar College would be weaving blockchain elements into its educational structure, as well as requiring that all payments to Vassar be sent in cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThis is gonna be, like, dope, dude,\u201d said Weebuloid, 24 and coincidentally a long-lost nephew of President Elizabeth Bradley. \u201cNo, like, seriously, we\u2019re going to the moon with this shizz. I\u2019ve got a bunch of sick ideas for what to do next, and the Board of Directors granted me full executive authority to implement all of them, so, like, hold on to your socks.\u201d\n\nAt a chaotic press conference in the Villard Room, Weebuloid enumerated the long list of changes that the College would be making to its educational system beginning in the fall. Among the major shifts that VAPERS will be spearheading is a total transition to distance education. Vassar will be an all-online university, and students will be able to generate NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, through the Learn-to-Earn, Get Internet Thingies (LEGIT) system. However, some students reacted negatively to the proposal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say I had no idea what Dean Weebuloid was smoking, but I could smell him from the back of the Villard Room, so I definitely do,\u201d junior Jim E. Jamsworth said. \u201cWhy on Earth is this crazy stoner suddenly the king of Vassar? I hate distance learning, and I really don\u2019t get NFTs either. Why should I spend hours in Spanish class just to get a fake Internet image?\u201d\n\nSources of student concern about the viability of NFTs as a store of value include the current crypto crash as well as the fact that non-fungible tokens are sometimes literally JPGs of stoned-looking monkeys that you can easily just copy and paste. In response, Weebuloid announced two new policies: Vassar will guarantee up to 3.5 percent of the value of each student\u2019s crypto wallet, and all student computers will also be permanently banned from right clicking. However, many students viewed these measures as insufficient.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d first-year Harold Mehta said. \u201cI got a letter from Vassar demanding my next semester\u2019s tuition in Pepecoin, but I just checked Coinbase and it looks like it spiked in value today by 35,499 percent? And now I owe the school almost $25 million? If my parents weren\u2019t rich investment bankers in Park Slope, this would be a real issue for me. Or I guess I could wait until tomorrow, when it will lose all its value again.\u201d\n\nProfessors in the Economics Department were especially displeased by the school\u2019s measures.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re handing over control of our economy to a bunch of Discord moderators who all look like Peter Griffin,\u201d Justine Wing \u201983, Junior Professor, said. \u201cAnd I really can\u2019t believe that people are making billions of dollars doing this. It makes me question the value of everything I\u2019ve spent my life studying and all the life choices that have led to this point\u2014and the whole reason I picked this field over Drama was to avoid that feeling!\u201d\n\nThe Miscellany News reached out to the Board of Directors for comment, but received in response only a poorly-photoshopped image of a dancing Pepe the Frog. However, one anonymous Board member could be reached at a public pay phone whose location The Misc pinpointed to a stretch of Route 9 just outside a dark, dank tunnel.\n\n\u201cLook, okay, it\u2019s part of the strategy,\u201d the Board member said, pausing for a long, phlegmy bout of smoker\u2019s cough. \u201cYou just have to trust us. Remember when we refused to let you take the COVID courses pass-fail? You know how we\u2019re spending millions of dollars on the donor-stroking Inn and Institute, rather than living wages for student workers? It\u2019s all for a reason. Believe me, Vassar is going to be unrecognizable in a decade\u2014and it\u2019s all going to be absolutely worth it. Just trust the process.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some students questioned what was going to be done with the campus buildings if the school is really going 100 percent online. However, at press time, intrepid Misc reporters discovered a file accidentally saved to a public Google Drive named \u201cRaymondLuxuryApartments.pdf.\u201d This may serve as an indication of the future direction of the school, as well as proof that we would all be better off if North America simply sank into the Atlantic Ocean. However, one student seemed unbothered by all the controversy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m graduating in May, so sayonara, suckers,\u201d Alyssa Willeford \u201923, a Misc contributor widely hailed as the Bob Woodward of completely made-up reporting, said. \u201cAll these issues are yours now. As for me? I\u2019m going on to bigger things. McDonald\u2019s, here I come!\u201d",

        "title": "Web 3.0 Developers Get the \u2018Magical\u2019 AI, CyberShib, for the Development of New Projects",
        "description": "CAPE CORAL , FL, March 15, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly utilized by the masses and this use is not just limited to getting questions answered or writing research papers, articles, and blogs. It is also being utilized to come up with unique designs, logos, and solutions to problems faced by skilled people in different sectors. Recently, the use of this innovation was included in the crypto industry which helped yield fantastic results. AI not only provides assistance for the development of the blockchain-based projects but is also steadily culling the problems faced by developers and users in the crypto sphere.\n\nWhat is Cybershib?\n\nCybershib is a newbie cryptocurrency firm built on the decentralized Shibarium network. The firm aspires to make web 3.0 development a piece of cake for every individual by handing over the developmental work to artificial intelligence.\n\nIndividuals planning on creating new projects simply have to enter their requirements as a command on the platform and wait for AI to do the rest of the job. Currently, users can access the firm\u2019s website and use the AI image generator to understand how things work.\n\nCybershib is currently working on the launch of a Pro version platform that will provide AI assistance to developers for creating new projects on the blockchain.\n\nThe $CHI AI PRO Version\n\nCybershib owns a superlative AI technology that has the capability of comprehending the complex systems of blockchain and providing flawless solutions to the problems faced by developers.

        "description": "Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet, and it\u2019s currently being built by several cryptocurrencies. Web 3.0 is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before\u2014it\u2019s a decentralized network that will allow users to interact with apps, websites, and other services without having to rely on third parties or intermediaries like Facebook or Google.\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 is the next generation of the internet. It\u2019s decentralized, secure and private. It will be built on blockchain technology and will be more efficient than its current iteration. Web 3.0 enables users to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0 Cryptos?\n\nWeb 3.0 is the next generation of the Internet. The third generation of web services, it\u2019s an ecosystem that consists of decentralized apps (DApps) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nWeb 3.0 has been in development since 2010, but it wasn\u2019t until 2017 that we saw real traction with its adoption by developers and investors alike. Since then we\u2019ve seen many projects launch their own versions of Web 3., such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ontology Network ($ONT), NEO ($NEO) and EOS ($EOS).\n\nWeb 3.0 differs from previous iterations because it\u2019s built on top of blockchain technology instead of traditional centralized servers like those used by Facebook or Google today \u2014 making it more secure than any previous version ever could be.\n\nWeb 3.0 Crypto Coins to Watch\n\nHelium (HNT)\n\nHelium (HNT) is a blockchain platform that aims to solve the scalability problem of decentralized applications.\n\nThe team behind Helium consists of experts in the field of cryptography and distributed systems, who have been working together since 2014. Their goal is to create a new type of blockchain that can support large-scale decentralized apps (dApps), allowing them to achieve their full potential by offering users better user experience and higher throughput.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the first cryptocurrency to use smart contracts. Ethereum\u2019s currency, Ether, acts as a fuel for the network and is used to pay transaction fees. Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015 after he published his white paper on blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum has since grown into a leading blockchain platform for decentralized apps (DApps) and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Users can trade ETH USDT pairs with ease using these digital assets.\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) is a trading platform built on the Dash blockchain. It\u2019s a fork of the Dash codebase and uses masternodes to validate transactions, which means that it\u2019s decentralized and anonymous. D2T has an API, allowing developers to create applications that integrate with their platform.\n\nHiens3\n\nHiens3 is a Crypto currency that is used to purchase products and services. It was created to be an alternative currency for the internet, specifically for web 3.0. Web 3.0 is a new way of thinking about the internet where individuals can share content and media in a decentralized manner instead of relying on big corporations and large companies to do this for them.\n\nHiens3 is a platform that will allow bloggers and content creators to publish their work on their own site without having to worry about advertisements or revenue, because Hien3 will be the revenue stream they rely on.\n\nFilecoin\n\nFilecoin is a decentralized storage network and cryptocurrency. The Filecoin network stores data on a blockchain and provides a payment to the nodes that store and serve the data.\n\nThe Filecoin network is powered by its native token, FIL.\n\nTheta Token\n\nTheta Token is a decentralized video streaming network that aims to solve the problem of high costs associated with content distribution on the internet. Theta Token is used to reward users for creating, sharing and viewing videos on its platform. It also allows users who contribute bandwidth to the network (through peer-to-peer streaming) to be rewarded in Theta Tokens as well.\n\nPolkadot\n\nPolkadot is a blockchain platform that allows for the creation of custom blockchains with unique functionalities, as well as interoperability between all of these different chains. In other words, Polkadot allows users to deploy their own blockchains and connect them together in a mesh-like structure.\n\nThis means that you can have one tokenized asset on one blockchain and another tokenized asset on another blockchain\u2013and they\u2019re still able to communicate with each other.\n\nPolkadot also supports cross-chain transactions, which means that any two tokens can be exchanged between two separate blockchains (or even multiple tokens).\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is a blockchain network that aims to address the scalability issues of existing blockchains. Solana is a consensus algorithm that can support up to 7,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nSolana is a DAG-based blockchain network with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as its consensus mechanism.\n\nSiacoin\n\nSiacoin is a cryptocurrency that was created to help in the decentralization of cloud storage. It\u2019s used as a payment method for users who want to rent out their unused hard drive space, and it\u2019s also one of the most popular coins on our list.\n\nIt is created as an alternative option for data storage that wasn\u2019t controlled by any specific entity. Their goal was to give people who don\u2019t have access or means of building their own cloud servers an opportunity at doing so by making it simple and affordable enough that anyone could participate in this new economy.\n\nBasic Attention Token (BAT)\n\nBasic Attention Token (BAT) is a token that can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform. The token will be exchanged between publishers, advertisers, and users who visit the website. It\u2019s based on Ethereum and uses the ERC-20 token standard.",

        "title": "Oracle (Blockchain Oracle)",
        "description": "What is an Oracle?\n\nAn oracle is a third-party service that enables a smart contract to access data from an external source.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe service acts as a bridge between a blockchain and information in the real world. Without this middleware layer, smart contracts would only be able to access data already on the blockchain. This would limit the usefulness of smart contracts in decentralized finance (DeFI), supply chain management (SCM), gaming and entertainment.\n\nHere are some examples of the types of information that an oracle might be requested to find and return:\n\nPrice data such as the current price of a specific cryptocurrency, stock or commodity. A smart contract might use this type of information to execute a financial transaction such as trading, lending or borrowing.\n\nWeather data such as the current temperature, precipitation, humidity level and wind speed for a specific location. A smart contract might use this type of information to trigger an event such as an insurance payout.\n\nSports data such as team schedules, game scores and player statistics. This information can be used by smart contracts for betting and gambling applications, as well as for fantasy sports and other games.\n\nTransportation data such as airport codes, train schedules and shipping updates. This information can be used by smart contracts to trigger certain events, such as payments or insurance claims.\n\nHealth data such as test results, HIPAA authorizations and patient histories. This information can be used by smart contracts for various applications, including insurance claims and clinical trials.\n\nHow They Work\n\nWhen a smart contract requires external data, it will send a request to the oracle by using a communication protocol like HTTPS.\n\nOnce the oracle receives the request for external data, it retrieves the requested data from one or more external sources. It then performs verification checks to ensure that the data is accurate and timely. Typically, these checks involve validating the authenticity of the data source and verifying that the data meets defined quality standards and has not been tampered with.\n\nOnce the data is validated and verified, the oracle sends the requested data to the smart contract in a format that\u2019s compatible with the smart contract\u2019s code. (For example, the oracle may encode the data in a standardized format like JSON before transmitting it using HTTPS.) Finally, the smart contract uses the data the oracle provided to execute its logic and functions.\n\nDepending upon the contract, an oracle may be compensated for its services with tokens or cryptocurrency coins.\n\nCentralized vs. Decentralized\n\nOracles can be centralized or decentralized. Centralized oracles rely on a single entity to collect and validate external data. In contrast, decentralized ones use a network of independent nodes to perform the same functions.\n\nCentralized oracles: A single entity (which could be an organization) is responsible for collecting and validating external data. This type of oracle typically collects data from multiple sources and uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify which source provided the most accurate and reliable data.\n\nDecentralized oracles: A network of independent nodes is responsible for collecting and validating external data. Decentralized oracles use consensus mechanisms to validate the accuracy and timeliness of external data before it\u2019s sent to the smart contract.\n\nIn general, decentralized oracles are considered to be more secure than centralized oracles because they reduce the risk of a single point of failure. Even if one node provides inaccurate data, the other nodes in the network will still provide accurate data. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that decentralized oracles can be more difficult to implement and can cost more to use than centralized oracles.\n\nPicking the Right Oracle\n\nThe choice of oracle can be a critical factor in the success or failure of a smart contract, because the oracle\u2019s reliability, transparency and security can have a significant impact on the performance of the contract.\n\nSome smart contract platforms like MakerDAO and Compound have their own oracles, but many platforms partner with a few well-known oracle services. Aave and Uniswap, for example, use Chainlink while Wanchain and Kava use Band Protocol as their default oracle.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the smart contract developer to choose which oracle to use when integrating external data into their contract. When selecting this type of third-party service, developers should evaluate the following:\n\nReputation: It\u2019s important for developers to know whether the provider is trusted within the DeFi community and whether they have experienced (and disclosed) security incidents or data breaches in the past.\n\nScalability: Third-party providers have lots of customers, so it\u2019s important to know how well the oracle can handle high traffic and large volumes of requests.\n\nSecurity: Developers should know the provider\u2019s policies for encryption and data privacy, as well as their plans for business continuity should they become the victim of a malicious attack.\n\nCost: This includes fees for accessing data in addition to any transaction fees associated with using the oracle.\n\nIntegration: Developers should look for third-party services that are compatible with their smart contract platform and research the oracle enough to have a sense of how easy it will be to integrate the oracle with contract\u2019s code.\n\nData Quality: The quality of the external data this type of service provides is critical. Developers should evaluate the timeliness and accuracy of the data the oracle provides, and understand what steps the service provider takes to validate and verify external data.\n\nTrustworthy Examples\n\nAlthough some platforms, like Ethereum, have built-in mechanisms for retrieving data from outside the blockchain, these mechanisms are typically limited in their capabilities and are not as robust as third-party services. Here are some examples of oracles that are regarded to be trustworthy:\n\nChainlink: Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides secure and reliable access to real-world data for smart contracts. Chainlink is known for its extensive network of nodes and its ability to provide verified data from multiple sources.\n\nBand Protocol: Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that provides smart contracts with decentralized access to trustworthy external data sources. Band Protocol is known for being scalable and easy to integrate with different blockchains.\n\nTellor: Tellor is a decentralized oracle network that provides smart contracts with access to high-quality data. Tellor is known for using proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data it provides.\n\nDIA: DIA is a decentralized oracle platform that provides transparent access to reliable data for decentralized software applications (DApps). DIA is known for its open-source data feeds and its ability to provide verifiable and auditable data from trusted sources.\n\nUMA: UMA is a decentralized financial contract platform that provides Dapps with access to price feeds. UMA is known for its ability to provide customizable financial contracts that can be tailored for specific needs.\n\nAPI3: API3 is a decentralized oracle that provides access to real-world price data for blockchain-based applications. API3 is known for transparency and providing just-in-time data updates for individual smart contracts",

        "title": "Get Ahead of the Game: Top 10 Web 3.0 Cryptos to Watch in 2023",
        "description": "Discover the potential of Web 3.0 Cryptos, the latest generation of cryptocurrencies that leverage blockchain technology and smart contracts. These innovative digital assets aim to realize the decentralized vision of Web 3.0 by enabling secure and efficient transactions without intermediaries while giving users full control over their data.\n\nAs the worldwide crypto market capitalization surpassed $3 million in 2021, the competition among cryptocurrencies has intensified, and it\u2019s expected to continue in 2023. With the rise of Web 3.0, the newest buzzword in the crypto sphere, the industry is set to expand even further.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Web 3.0 focuses on decentralization and user empowerment. But what exactly is Web 3.0, and which Web 3.0 crypto coins are worth investing in? Our article provides you with a curated list of the best and safest Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on and buy as a long-term investment. With over 1000 Web 3.0 cryptos available, making informed investment decisions can be challenging. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 is the latest term used to describe the Internet\u2019s next significant evolution, aiming to address issues related to the ownership and security of user data. In the early days of the internet, Web 1.0 (1990-2004) was characterized by static websites controlled by large corporations, while the Web 2.0 era (2004-2020) became synonymous with user-generated content on social media platforms.\n\nHowever, this led to the centralization of data by tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, which caused privacy and security concerns. The emergence of Web 3.0 is set to change this, with a focus on decentralization and peer-to-peer transactions that give users control over their data.\n\nWeb 3.0 aims to leverage blockchain technology to enhance data openness and content accessibility, with the potential to revolutionize other sectors through artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the metaverse.\n\nThe adoption of Web 3.0 could eliminate the need for centralized authorities that store user data, putting control back in the hands of users rather than corporations. Our article explores the significance of Web 3.0 and the potential benefits of this next-generation internet evolution.\n\nWeb 2.0 Vs. Web 3.0\n\nIn the world of technology, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 may seem similar, but they approach challenges differently. While Web 2.0 is primarily used for reading and writing content, Web 3.0 is a semantic web used for creating content. This difference allows for smoother information interchange and enhanced cybersecurity in Web 3.0.\n\nOne major difference between the two is currency. In Web 2.0, transactions are usually paid for with fiat currency. In contrast, Web 3.0 transactions are facilitated using cryptocurrencies, encrypted digital currencies used to fund transactions.\n\nAnother key difference is content ownership. Web 2.0 networks control information storage, raising concerns about data access, anonymity, and security. However, Web 3.0 allows for direct and simultaneous data exchange between users, ensuring greater security and control over personal data.\n\nWeb 2.0 focuses on interactive and collaborative internet technologies, such as social media, blogging, and video sharing. In contrast, Web 3.0 introduces concepts like AI-powered DApps, 3D portals, and virtual worlds like the metaverse.\n\nLastly, Web 3.0 offers increased data security and privacy. Users\u2019 data is anonymized, and their digital identity is not linked to their real identity, unlike in Web 2.0 where companies can track or trace users\u2019 data. This is because all data is stored in the blockchain.\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0 Cryptos?\n\nWeb 3.0 cryptos, also known as decentralized digital currencies, utilize smart contracts to secure blockchain projects or enable their native blockchains to function. A prominent example is Ether (ETH), the official currency of the Ethereum blockchain, which is used to pay for transactions like game purchases and fees.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible to complete these transactions using Web 2.0, Web 3.0 coins provide greater privacy, allowing users to carry out their transactions without the oversight of a third party. Additionally, Web 3.0 puts users in control of their data, meaning those who use Web 3.0 coins effectively own a piece of the internet.\n\nWhat Sets Web 3.0 Crypto Apart From Other Cryptos?\n\nDuring the dominance of tech giants such as Facebook and Google, Web 3.0 emerged to challenge their practices of monetizing users\u2019 data. With Web 3.0, users have the right to own their data and benefit from it by selling it to advertisers while retaining data privacy.\n\nUnlike Web 2.0, where users need separate accounts for different social media platforms and online shopping, Web 3.0 offers a decentralized version of the internet where users only need one account to access various services.\n\nWeb 3.0 isn\u2019t a specific cryptocurrency or blockchain but a decentralized internet that requires Web 3.0 crypto coins to access its services. These coins operate on public blockchains with trustlessness, decentralization, equal access, and open-source technology.\n\nWith Web 3.0 crypto coins, users can access various services, including data storage, network infrastructure, social media, NFTs, and blockchain gaming. Despite the current turbulence in the crypto sphere, numerous Web 3.0 projects are coming up, making it crucial to learn about the best Web 3.0 crypto coins to watch for.\n\nOur guide covers the top Web 3.0 crypto coins based on their utility, continuing traction, and network effect. This information will help you decide whether to invest in them and benefit from the growing Web 3.0 ecosystem.\n\n1. Helium (HNT)\n\nHelium is a blockchain network that operates in a decentralized manner and is fueled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and devices using the proof-of-coverage algorithm.\n\nBy leveraging Helium, users can establish a wireless infrastructure that is decentralized and allows low-power devices to communicate and transmit data using a network of nodes called hotspots, which cover a specific percentage of the network. Acting as miners, these hotspots enable users to both operate nodes and mine HNT, the blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, as the original smart-contract blockchain, has continued to be a top player in the market. It is an open-source blockchain that supports numerous DApps and DeFi networks, making it a popular Web 3.0 crypto coin.\n\nRecently, Ethereum underwent an upgrade known as The Merge, which involved a switch from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This change further solidified Ethereum\u2019s position as a blockchain of choice for many users.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is home to several leading NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. OpenSea features the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection (BAYC) of NFT tokens, making Ethereum an attractive investment for NFT enthusiasts.\n\n3.

        "title": "Understanding the current state of crypto assets in India",
        "description": "It is a sweeping wave for some and a conundrum for others but crypto is the new buzzword in the world of investment finance. Crypto is part of the Web 3.0 internet landscape which decentralises ownership and alters the concept of one or more big entities wielding control over everyday lives.\n\nCrypto has been on Indian investors\u2019 radar recently. It is estimated that India has 25 to 30 million investors with an exposure to this asset class. This is set to grow multi-fold over the next 3-5 years. But how do India and its government officially treat its status? We identify key trends around this and enlist the challenges the industry faces.\n\nThe last 3 years: From the sidelines to mainstream\n\nCrypto, like many new technologies, was on the sidelines in India till 2020. Indians could sense a reluctance to even take cognisance of the sector. However, with increased adoption across the world and in India, the government\u2019s stance on virtual digital assets (VDAs), as they are termed, has undergone a significant transformation.\n\nNow, the government has stated that it is taking a \u2018studied approach\u2019 to VDAs and trying to ascertain its usefulness or necessity or both. Recognition with a major legal mandate in the form of direct taxation of 30% and a 1% TDS followed in 2022. India has notably collected INR 157.9 crore in the past year via this initiative.\n\nThis could have been much higher if not for traders using global exchanges that don\u2019t follow Indian laws. This issue has also been addressed recently. Earlier this month, the Union government brought crypto under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which puts the onus on users to declare their transactions and TDS. It also made it mandatory for crypto entities to adopt KYC and enhanced due diligence (EDD) procedures, just like banks and key financial institutions. Crypto exchanges are also made as reporting entities wherein they would red-flag suspicious transactions to the government. This has unified the local crypto ecosystem and has enabled platforms to follow consistent processes and services to their users.\n\nOn the whole, the government seems to be accepting crypto and the underlying blockchain technology rather than casting them away as \u2018risky\u2019 or even \u2018banning\u2019 them.\n\nBanking is still not a breeze given RBI\u2019s concerns\n\nThe RBI continues to be doubtful of the \u2018underlying value\u2019 of crypto assets. Despite the launch of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot late last year, RBI has not adequately supported the crypto ecosystem till date.\n\nBanks are still not forthcoming with partnerships with exchanges to help convert INR to crypto. NPCI even blocked UPI from being used for this purpose. However, we anticipate this to change in the coming year as the Union government continues to enhance its initiative to provide a safety net to crypto investors.\n\nCBDCs and crypto conceptually align at certain points. Both CBDCs and cryptos are \u2018safe stores of value\u2019 and users can store both in digital wallets. In fact, the adoption of RBI\u2019s CBDC (eRupee) is expected to give an impetus to the use of crypto assets as well if it is recognized as a safe on-ramp for INR to crypto transactions.\n\nFrom the government's perspective, digital transactions can now be easily monitored, and money laundering operations are halted. The eRupee can be incorporated into decentralised applications with the development of blockchain technology, thereby making it a vital part of the Web 3.0 ecosystem.\n\nEducation and awareness: the key challenge in crypto adoption\n\nThe foremost challenge in India\u2019s crypto adoption is the awareness of its complexity and its associated volatility. Indian users understand that this is an asset class that can give disproportionate returns, but they often fail to manage the risks involved.\n\nOver-leveraging, investing in fraudulent projects, falling to scams etc. are some issues that the masses need to be educated on. There is a latent need for top-down programs that address awareness in vernacular languages now. That said, the services offered by crypto platforms are on par with global peers while the customer support ecosystem in various languages is being strengthened.\n\nThe volatility of crypto assets is another key issue. We propagate an investor mentality (investing over multiple years) rather than a trader mindset (seeking short-term gains) to be successful in crypto.\n\nWe believe in a bright future\n\nCrypto and blockchain tech holds the potential to bring a change across industries for the benefit of the masses. As the government and the crypto sector work together, the challenges of greater adoption, regulation and awareness will hopefully be addressed soon.\n\nAuthor: Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nKnow your inner investor Do you have the nerves of steel or do you get insomniac over your investments?

        "title": "The next phase of the internet is coming: Here\u2019s what you need to know about Web3",
        "description": "There are many misconceptions surrounding this buzzy (and, frankly, fuzzy) term, including the conflation of Web3 with Web 3.0. Here\u2019s what you need to know about these terms.\n\nThe rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and virtual non-fungible tokens have dominated news headlines in recent years. But not many may see how these modish applications connect together in a wider idea being touted by some as the next iteration of the internet \u2014 Web3.\n\nThere are many misconceptions surrounding this buzzy (and, frankly, fuzzy) term, including the conflation of Web3 with Web 3.0. Here\u2019s what you need to know about these terms.\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nSince Web3 is still a developing movement, there\u2019s no universal agreement among experts about its definition. Simply put, Web3 is envisioned to be a \u201cdecentralized web ecosystem,\u201d empowering users to bypass internet gatekeepers and retain ownership of their data.\n\nThis would be done through blockchain; rather than relying on single servers and centralized databases, Web3 would run off of public ledgers where data is stored on computer networks that are chained together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decentralized Web3 would fundamentally change how the internet operates \u2014 financial institutions and tech companies would no longer need to be intermediaries of our online experiences.\n\nAs one business reporter put it:\n\n\u201cIn a Web3 world, people control their own data and bounce around from social media to email to shopping using a single personalized account, creating a public record on the blockchain of all of that activity.\u201d\n\nWeb3\u2019s blockchain-based infrastructure would open up intriguing possibilities by ushering in the era of the \u201ctoken economy.\u201d The token economy would allow users to monetize their data by providing them with tokens for their online interactions. These tokens could offer users perks or benefits, including ownership stakes in content platforms or voting rights in online communities.\n\nTo better understand Web3, it helps to step back and see how the internet developed into what it is now.\n\nWeb 1.0: The \u2018read-only\u2019 web\n\nComputer scientist Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the world wide web in 1989, which allowed people to hyperlink static pages of information on websites accessible through internet browsers.\n\nBerners-Lee was exploring more efficient ways for researchers at different institutions to share information. In 1991, he launched the world\u2019s first website, which provided instructions on using the internet.\n\nThese basic \u201cread-only\u201d websites were managed by webmasters who were responsible for updating users and managing the information. In 1992, there were 10 websites. By 1994, after the web entered the public domain, there were 3,000.\n\nWhen Google arrived in 1996 there were two million. Last year, there were approximately 1.2 billion websites, although it is estimated only 17 per cent are still active.\n\nWeb 2.0: The social web\n\nThe next major shift for the internet saw it develop from a \u201cread-only web\u201d to where we are currently \u2014 a \u201cread-write web.\u201d Websites became more dynamic and interactive. People became mass participants in generating content through hosted services like Wikipedia, Blogger, Flickr and Tumblr.\n\nThe idea of \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d gained traction after technology publisher Tim O\u2019Reilly popularized the term in 2004.\n\nLater on, social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram and the growth of mobile apps led to unparalleled connectivity, albeit through distinct platforms. These platforms are known as walled gardens because their parent companies heavily regulate what users are able to do and there is no information exchange between competing services.\n\nTech companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are deeply embedded into every facet of our lives, from how we store and pay for our content to the personal data we offer (sometimes without our knowledge) to use their wares.\n\nWeb3 vs. Web 3.0\n\nThis brings us to the next phase of the internet, in which many wish to wrest back control from the entities that have come to hegemonize it.\n\nThe terms Web3 and Web 3.0 are often used interchangeably, but they are different concepts.\n\nWeb3 is the move towards a decentralized internet built on blockchain. Web 3.0, on the other hand, traces back to Berners-Lee\u2019s original vision for the internet as a collection of websites linking everything together at the data level.\n\nOur current internet can be thought of as a gigantic document depot. Computers are capable of retrieving information for us when we ask them to, but they aren\u2019t capable of understanding the deeper meaning behind our requests.\n\nInformation is also siloed into separate servers. Advances in programming, natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence would allow computers to discern and process information in a more \u201chuman\u201d way, leading to more efficient and effective content discovery, data sharing and analysis. This is known as the \u201csemantic web\u201d or the \u201cread-write-execute\u201d web.\n\nIn Berners-Lee\u2019s Web 3.0 world, information would be stored in databases called Solid Pods, which would be owned by individual users. While this is a more centralized approach than Web3\u2019s use of blockchain, it would allow data to be changed more quickly because it wouldn\u2019t be distributed over multiple places.\n\nIt would allow, for example, a user\u2019s social media profiles to be linked so that updating the personal information on one would automatically update the rest.\n\nThe next era of the internet\n\nWeb3 and Web 3.0 are often mixed up because the next era of the internet will likely feature elements of both movements \u2014 semantic web applications, linked data and a blockchain economy. It\u2019s not hard to see why there is significant investmenthappening in this space.\n\nBut we\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the logistical issues and legal implications. Governments need to develop new regulations for everything from digital asset sales taxation to consumer protections to the complex privacy and piracy concerns of linked data.\n\nThere are also critics who argue that Web3, in particular, is merely a contradictory rebranding of cryptocurrency that will not democratize the internet. While it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve arrived at the doorstep of a new internet era, it\u2019s really anyone\u2019s guess as to what happens when we walk through that door.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "description": "March 21st, 2023 \u2013 Istanbul, Turkey\n\nMetatime has announced that it has raised a total of $11 million in investment through two seed sales held to develop the Web 3.0 ecosystem.\n\nThis leaves only two rounds before the presale closes and the hotly anticipated token finally lists on public exchanges.\n\nThe funds raised in the two seed sale rounds held before the initial public offering will support Metatime\u2019s goal of expanding its Web 3.0 product range.\n\nUnder the umbrella of Yildiz Tekno GSYO A.S., leading investors including Halkbank, Kalyon Holding, Yildiz Technical University, and T\u00fcrk Telekom provided a total of $11 million in funding to Metatime. Also, more than 10 angel investors participated in the two-stage seed sale. The locks of 10% of the MetaCoins (MTC) sold in the two-stage seed sale will be opened after the final public offering, which will end on November 11, 2023. The remaining 90% will be linearly released for use starting from the main launch date of November 11, 2023, for a period of 225 days.\n\nThe demand collection process, which started on March 3 and will continue until March 23, is ongoing. With high demand for the first private sale of MTC, investors are vying to own MetaCoin at a fixed price of USD 0.07. Metatime has released all the details of the private sale ahead of the demand collection that will end on March 23.\n\nMetatime Co-Founder and CEO Yusuf Sevim said,\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to all the seed investors who supported us. Their investments will help us break new ground in blockchain technology and expand the ecosystem. We started our investment process with the first demand collection on March 3, and we are very pleased with the interest the campaign has received. We expect this process to help us achieve our goal of creating the world\u2019s most comprehensive Web 3.0 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nYildiz Tekno GSYO A.S., which participated in the private sale, said,\n\n\u201cWe are proud to support Metatime\u2019s goals of introducing blockchain technology to people of all ages, and we wish the team success.\u201d\n\nMetatime\u2019s first products under development include a cryptocurrency exchange and a blockchain network, which will be the foundation of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Other products currently being developed include MetaNFT Marketplace, MetaLaunchpad, MetaExplorer, MetaWallet, MetaCoin, and MetaStablecoin.\n\nWith MetaChain supported by the Proof of Meta consensus mechanism, Web 3.0 users can participate in network verification and MTC mining. MetaExchange, built on the Metatime ecosystem, is a platform designed for users of all levels. With Lite, Pro, and Meta versions, MetaExchange will set a precedent by not assessing commissions for trades that closed at loss. Additionally, a copy trading feature allows novices to profit from emulating the experts.\n\nAs the first centralized cryptocurrency exchange to offer a completely transparent order book, MetaExchange will prove that all transactions are executed correctly and that there is no attempt at market manipulation.\n\nAbout Metatime\n\nMetatime is a complete blockchain ecosystem for giving individuals entry to web3 in all its forms. From NFTs to trading and gaming to saving, Metatime incorporates a range of powerful products that will give network users full control over their finances, identity, and assets.

        "title": "How 5ire Is Transforming The Blockchain Revolution",
        "description": "It has been a difficult few weeks for the world - political turmoil across various geographies, market uncertainty, inflation and negative blowback of the global recession. We are conscious of the macro realities facing us but thanks to the support of our community, we have been steadfast building 5ireChain.\n\nIn a little over a month from launch, we had hit our first big milestone of a million transactions on the EVM and Native chain respectively.\n\nToday I want to reflect on the importance of world building and nurturing a community. That\u2019s something we have done diligently from day 1. In addition to the traction, building with our community cheering for us has made it even more meaningful.\n\nWhat is world building and why does it matter?\n\nPhilosopher and Shopify executive Alex Danco wrote, \u201cEveryone\u2019s job is world-building (selling is not enough) even if they don\u2019t realize it.\u201d In this newsletter, I will draw upon his concept of world building and connect it with what we are building at 5ire.\n\nIt is often said that everyone\u2019s job is in sales even if they don\u2019t know it. Danco says that we shouldn\u2019t throw that piece of advice out, but update it to say in this world of abundance on the internet, everyone\u2019s job is world building.\n\n\u201cYour job is actually to create a world that is so interesting and so compelling and has a reason for people to go walk in and explore this world that they can go spend time in it, without you even having to be there.\u201d\n\nWorld-building has been such an adventure on 5ire. Thanks to all our community members for co-creating this new world of sustainable blockchains. Our business is not about selling a particular currency but rather about building a new, decentralized and sustainable internet powered by web 3.0.\n\nCreating a compelling narrative, one that is familiar, surprising and inclusive requires deep understanding of what citizens (consumers) really want from this world. It is an interesting problem to solve, requiring intimate understanding of technology, sociology, psychology, philosophy and popular culture. That\u2019s what makes work energizing for us.\n\nDanco says that our success in world-building depends entirely on how successfully other people can repeat narratives, both to themselves and others.\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe more complex or valuable is whatever you\u2019re trying to sell, the more important it is for you to build a world around that idea, where other people can walk in, explore, and hang out \u2013 without you having to be there with them the whole time.\u201d\n\nWe understand the complexity of our mission and vision at 5ire. That\u2019s why we have created a large community of ambassadors, community champions, and city leaders to help scale our narrative around sustainable blockchains.\n\nComplexity, Compounding and World Building\n\n\u201cEasy worlds are boring and people leave, worlds need to have challenges in them and jungle gyms for people to climb on and go explore.\u201d\n\nWorldbuilding cannot be done alone. We need a community, a network of champions, thousands of true fans all working with you to build something that matters.\n\nEspecially if you want to bring out systemic change, sequential or disjoined effort won\u2019t do much. Danco emphasizes the importance of parallel effort where several different things happen concomitantly. That\u2019s how things change, movements get built and people inch closer to building their category of one.\n\nWe keep these principles in mind as we design our product, research, marketing and community-building strategy\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nNo matter what you do, immerse yourself in world-building. Whether you are a data scientist trying to figure out the metaverse or a community builder trying to make the world a more equitable place or an activist fighting for climate change, you won\u2019t get far if all you are trying to do is to sell.\n\nAs a layer 1 blockchain company, world building is our top priority. It goes hand in hand with technology, research and R&D. All our AMAs, events, hackathons, blogs, research papers are designed to help you build the world with us. Thanks so much for all your efforts thus far. We greatly appreciate it.\n\nUtkarsh Amitabh is the CEO of Network Capital and the Chief Marketing Officer of 5ire.org, a blockchain unicorn valued at $1.5 Billion. 5ire.org acquired a stake in his company Network Capital (networkcapital.tv), one of the world\u2019s largest mentorship platforms that empowers 1.6 million school students and 150,000+ young professionals to build meaningful careers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article above are those of the authors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this publishing house.

        "title": "Digital marketing trends to watch out for in 2023: Krishna Mohan Jha, Nine Triangles, CIO News, ET CIO",
        "description": "By- Krishna Mohan Jha,\n\n\n\nThe last few years have been a tumultuous ride for marketing teams, navigating through a pandemic, tectonic shifts in consumer behaviour, a V-shaped recovery - against the backdrop of geo-political turmoil, economic instability, rising inflation, and job cuts, the prospect of an economic recession is looming over us in 2023 Despite these external challenges, marketing teams must be prepared to tackle them head-on and drive growth for their organizations. With digital media taking centre stage in the creation of marketing strategies, let's explore the dominant trends that will shape the digital marketing landscape in 2023.Gen Zs are fast becoming the dominant consumer group - of all the active customer segments, Zen Zs are the most distinct one. They are the truly digitally native generations with no experience or baggage of the past behaviour clouding how they would be behaving with the new media. They are now the active consumer set for all kinds of organisations - B2B and B2C alike, though their share in the business is going to differ though. Therefore, it is imperative for the brands to align their marketing plans for this set of audiences across facets of communication - creativity, experience and choice of media. Content Marketing is taking centre stage - we are living in an era where consumer regardless of categories spends a considerable amount of time online before engaging with a brand or product category. So content plays a huge role in the discovery and nurturing engagement. Also, the content that they consume is broad both in terms of the characteristics of the content and the medium via which it is delivered to the audience.Content, therefore, is going to be an extremely important piece of digital marketing strategy - where brands need to research and work on the content strategy not only as a matter of blog topics or isolated posts on social media but thinking of content strategy from a holistic perspective of being of use to the consumer in their buying/acquisition journey.Video, Voice and Vernacular will continue to rule - In India, the rapid rise of the internet has been driven by users in Tier II and beyond, who show a strong preference for consuming content in their local languages. As a result, vernacular has to be an essential component of digital marketing strategies of all kinds. With the increasing adoption of voice-enabled devices, voice search is also growing at a high rate, making it necessary for brands to optimize their websites for voice search. Furthermore, the popularity of audio-visual content consumption is no secret, as evidenced by the massive user base of YouTube in India.According to a report by Google , many users turn to YouTube to learn something new, providing brands with an opportunity to reach their target audience with relevant content. Short-format video content, in particular, has gained significant popularity and should be leveraged by brands to capture the attention of their audience.Adoption of Web 3.0 Technologies - while it is a difficult job for brand marketers to strike a balance between hype and marketing dollar spend, there are times when the adoption of technologies for wading into a trend becomes a necessity and essential investment. Most brands are at that stage when it comes to Web 3.0. While there is a very little case of very effective ROI on Web 3.0 adoption but the certainty of its adoption to match changing consumer behaviour can not be ruled out.From creating actual virtual touch-and-feel experiences for customers to simulations of all kinds - Web 3.0 is a tool for brands to empower their customers with rich experience, convenience and closer to how they would feel after acquiring the product. This empowerment is a sure-shot winner of customers\u2019 affinity.Advocacy & Influencer Marketing 2.0 - customers today are quite equipped with the knowledge of what is happening in the marketing world, and the gimmicks of pure nature reach quickly to their knowledge. It is time that a lot of brands will re-innovate to become more authentic with their advocacy and influencer marketing exercise. Engagement with micro & Neo influencers will take centerstage - the use of technology to map them right will be of paramount importance. Content planning in a manner that serves audience interest not that of the influencer or the brand is going to be defining trends for the brands winning in this segment.Personalised and contextual communication - This is continuing trend and a lot of tech enablement has come to this area of marketing. Be it communicating with existing customers or with new customers, the role of personalisation and context remains the deciding factor for engagement ratios of all kinds. Apart from tech interventions, brands would need to work on communication strategies to generate and serve real-time communication which is personalised and in context for the consumer. This is going to be one winning strategy for brands across categories.Focus on owned data oil - In a world where data privacy is becoming more important, businesses will need to focus on their own data rather than relying on third-party cookies for personalization and contextual communication. As a result, companies will need to devise their own data strategies, with a particular emphasis on capturing data ethically and in compliance with regulations.This will require creating mechanisms for collecting customer data at key touch points throughout the customer journey, and mining insights from that data to inform communication strategies. As we move towards a cookie-less world, the ability to effectively manage and leverage owned data will be a key factor in digital marketing success in 2023 and beyond.",

        "description": "Cardano Utilises its Sustainability\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. As a result, the energy efficiency of the cryptocurrency is improved. The traditional proof-of-work consensus mechanism necessitates more mining and contributes to a longer transaction time. The blockchain was created in 2017, and four years later, the \u201cAlonzo\u201d hard fork was introduced. With the hard fork, its smart contract functionality is established. Smart contracts are difficult to hack due to their encrypted security. Cardano\u2019s commitment to transaction security has aided its development into a strong blockchain platform. The speed and efficiency of its transactions, as well as its smart contract, contribute to its environmental friendliness! Investing has a high potential for success.\n\nSolana Operates its Special Mechanism\n\nSolana (SOL), a decentralised blockchain platform, is completely open-source. Because of their smart contract functionality, the proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms combine to make the cryptocurrency energy-efficient and offer scalable and quick transactions. Solana remains focused on its long-term viability and future in Web 3.0; they intend to create exclusive NFTs. If you enjoy playing video games, you\u2019re in luck! Solana has released a free-to-play battle royale game called \u201cBladerite,\u201d which is also powered by it. Another advantage is that they\u2019re less expensive with transaction costs! We now have a cryptocurrency that is among the best and most long-lasting! You could interact with these elements and possibly profit by investing.\n\nSignuptoken.com \u2013 Initiating the Millionaires Club\n\nAfter reaching its goal, Signuptoken.com intends to make its debut on the Uniswap (UNI) platform.

        "description": "On 8 February 2023, a New York jury delivered its long-awaited verdict in a case brought by the French luxury brand Herm\u00e8s, against the artist Mason Rothschild. The latter began selling NFTs (\u201cnon-fungible tokens\u201d) of the iconic Herm\u00e8s Birkin handbags, which take their name from the Anglo-French actress and singer, Jane Birkin, in late 2021. According to Herm\u00e8s, that infringed its trademark rights, and the jury agreed. Rothschild must pay $133,000 in damages (i.e. plus minus 125,000 euros).\n\nBackground\n\nThe \u2018ball\u2019 in this case started \u2018rolling\u2019 when Rothschild presented his Metabirkins collection at Art Basel Miami in December 2021 and began selling it through NFT platforms like OpenSea. The collection consisted of 100 NFTs with digital images of Herm\u00e8s Birkin bags in various designs. The starting price for one copy was 0.1 ETH (about $450 at the time). The artist was said to have soon sold more than $1 million worth of digital handbags.\n\nHerm\u00e8s Birkin\n\nMetaBirkin\n\nAfter a formal notice from Herm\u00e8s, OpenSea removed the Metabirkin collection from its platform. Rothschild, however, refused to stop selling his virtual handbags. He invoked his artistic freedom of expression based on the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nUnimpressed with this argument, Herm\u00e8s decided to file suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Finding in favour of the French fashion house, the jury decided that Rothschild was guilty of trademark infringement (among other things). The artist was also convicted of cybersquatting by unlawfully registering the MetaBirkins.com domain name to promote the NFTs.\n\nThe case and ruling have been followed with great interest by IP professionals worldwide, as it is one of the first tests of whether existing IP law, and in particular trademark law, is sufficiently resilient to deal with the emergence of new Web 3.0 applications such as NFTs.\n\nOf course, there is still a long way to go and the (case) law will continue to evolve. However, cautiously one or two conclusions can be drawn from this case.\n\nTrademark law holds up in Web 3.0\n\nThe law often runs behind the times. Rarely is legislation prepared for technological (r)evolutions. Instead, legislation has to be adapted a posteriori to the new reality.\n\nIn the field of intellectual property, this is very noticeable in copyright law. Just about every major adaptation of copyright law has been caused by a technological (r)evolution that brings with it new exploitation opportunities. Ongoing innovations in the digital world continue to put pressure on the legislative framework. The recent NFT hype (which is not as new as one might think, as the first NFT dates from 2014) is just one of them.\n\nCompared to copyright law, trademark law overall seems a bit more digital-proof. Still, the sudden \u2018explosion\u2019 of the NFT phenomenon has raised questions. One key question is whether and to what extent trademark rights can be enforced against NFTs, which use a trademark, and other applications from the new Internet (e.g. the metaverse)? That question was also at issue in the Metabirkins case.\n\nThe New York jury\u2019s answer is positive. So, trademark holders, and certainly holders of well-known brands such as Herm\u00e8s, which enjoy broader protection than less known brands, can breathe a sigh of relief: their rights are also valuable in the new digital world and can be enforced.\n\nThis will, obviously, be easier today for trademarks registered (among others) for NFTs. This is possible since the 1 January 2023 update of the Nice classification (the list of goods and services for which trademarks can be registered). Class 9 now explicitly refers to NFTs (\u201cdownloadable digital files authenticated by non-fungible tokens [NFTs]\u201d).\n\nDespite the attention that has gone to the Metabirkins case, it is not the first time that a court has ruled that an NFT amounts to a trademark infringement. While this is the first U.S. case, the first known case is from Europe. In July 2022, a court in Rome ruled that the \u201cminting\u201d and commercialization of NFTs with the \u201cJuventus\u201d trademark infringed the trademark rights of the football team of the same name.\n\nAn NFT can be \u201cart\u201d but\u2026\n\nWhen NFTs relate to artistic creations, artistic freedom of expression quickly comes into play in their creation and sale. The question, then, is whether and to what extent artistic freedom may take precedence over trademark law.\n\nRothschild invoked the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment (\u201cfreedom of speech\u201d). He defended his Metabirkins by arguing that the First Amendment gave him the right to create art based on his interpretation of the world around him. According to him, the Metabirkins are \u201ca playful abstraction of an existing fashion-culture landmark\u201d reinterpreted by him, and also an indictment of the use of fur.\n\nHerm\u00e8s disputed the application of artistic freedom, claiming that Rothschild had no real artistic intent (more rather a commercial purpose) in promoting and selling the NFTs.\n\nAt a preliminary stage the court swept this aside, stating: \u201ca court may not strip an artistic work of First Amendment protection merely because the artist seeks to market and sell his creative output.\u201d\n\nThis turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, as the jury ultimately decided that Rothschild could not hide behind artistic freedom. So, the trademark proprietor eventually prevailed.\n\nYet the final word has not been said, as Rothschild has announced an appeal. The future will tell whether Herm\u00e8s will win the war\u2026 or whether its victory was only virtual.",

        "title": "Crypto Continues To Surge: Which Are The Best Tokens To Buy This Season?",
        "description": "The crypto market has sprung into action again. Lit green, top cryptocurrencies are reversing the losses they made last year with new vigor.\n\nBut can they sustain the upturns?\n\nNot all of them can. Those backed by robust projects with disrupting visions and ambitious roadmaps will, however. Here is a look at the top three cryptocurrencies that make excellent investments this season.\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBTC has taken a steep upturn in the last few days, briefly crossing $26,000 before pulling back to $24,683.09. An 11.75% rise in the weekly charts has instilled faith in investors to turn most of the market green. But what is more surprising is the fact that the BTC market cap has outstripped Meta, JPMorgan Chase, and Visa to name a few. It is tailing tech giant Tesla now.\n\nBTC 7D price chart, 15 Mar 2023\n\nMuch of the dramatic turn of events has to do with the crisis in the banking sector. Evidently, people are losing trust in traditional financial services. They are on the lookout for more decentralized and democratic alternatives. It doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that their eyes have struck cryptocurrencies. BTC will continue to tap into this new stream of investments in the next months.\n\nWhile a quick jump to the all-time high of $68,789 seems unlikely, BTC can cross $45,000 if the market maintains the momentum.\n\n2. Stacks (STX)\n\nStacks is inarguably one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of 2023. The token has taken a 237.0% leap in the last thirty days alone. That doesn\u2019t come as a shock, since the project enables smart contracts and decentralized applications to use Bitcoin as an asset and settle transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSTX 3M price chart, 15 Mar 2023\n\nIf the project\u2019s robust makeup and roadmap are any evidence, STX still has a long way to go.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe market cap of $1,372,840,578 doesn\u2019t justify the market relevance of the project.\n\n3. Swords of Blood ($SWDTKN)\n\nCrypto gaming has played a key role in taking blockchain and digital assets to the mainstream. They bridge the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. Crypto gaming tokens should make up at least 20% of your crypto portfolio, since gaming accounts for half of all blockchain use. $SWDTKN, the native cryptocurrency of Swords of Blood , is an excellent gaming token to buy this year.\n\nSwords of Blood is the first AAA-quality fast-paced F2P hack-and-slash RPG in the blockchain, launching on Polygon.\n\nOwing to its flashy combat, stellar graphics, and various game modes, the game is widely speculated to become the biggest blockchain game of 2023.\n\nSwords of Blood is built on the framework of an award-winning title that was first published in 2019. Despite the limited access and features, the MVP has been downloaded by over 4M players from App Store and Play Store. That speaks for its gripping gameplay. It features asynchronous game modes like main campaign dungeons in three difficulty levels, monster Hunt dungeons (where you play against waves of progressively harder monsters), and Boss Fortress (where you team up with four other players to fight against powerful bosses).\n\nThe reimagined game will step it up with 4, 8, and 16-player PVP modes, play-to-own and improved free-to-play mechanics, E-sports micro tournaments, community-based gaming with guilds and clans, and multichain crypto payment integration via SphereOne to name a few.\n\nThe game is free to play, like any traditional game. At the same time, it is set apart and improved by the blockchain features that expand its economy.\n\nThe game\u2019s technical gap is bridged by a custodial wallet (Stardust) that you receive upon signing up. That means you don\u2019t have to download and set up a wallet outside the game. You can store, buy, and sell $SWDTKN (native token) and in-game GUTS directly in just a few clicks. GUTs, expanded as Game Utility Tokens, are the NFTs in Swords of Blood.\n\nSwords of Blood supports the purchase of $SWDTKN using your Mastercard or Visa card via Simplex, thus featuring a smooth onboarding experience for crypto newbies.\n\nSwords of Blood has partnered with leading industry players like Fundamental Labs, Solana Ventures, Master Ventures, Gate.io Labs, Magnus Capital, Flame, and Acknoledger.\n\nThe Swords of Blood team is piloted by game development veterans like CEO James Seaman, who has more than 35 years of industry exposure. Their roots in the traditional market will help the project amass a broader audience.\n\nAnother important factor that underscores the appeal of the project is that the token is currently in the presale phase. That is, you can stock up on the tokens at heavily discounted prices before the broader market follows suit. The $SWDTKN presale is held in March 2023 in three stages, leaving large room for returns for early investors. The price will increase as the presale moves to the next stages.\n\nAs an early token holder, you also become eligible for the game\u2019s closed beta, automatic whitelisting to future NFT sales, and phygital giveaways.\n\nVisit Swords of Blood",

        "description": "The world of Cryptocurrency is basically a legitimate ecosystem which requires legitimate people to advise new users who are investing in it as a means of wealth generation. \u200b\u200b\n\nNew Delhi (India), March 31: Cryptocurrency is a digital currency exchange that is controlled by a digital ledger system and is not maintained by any central authority. It is the fastest-growing trading system in the world, with millions of people buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets every minute.\n\nA blockchain is a digital, decentralised ledger that offers technology to secure a way for individuals to deal directly with each other without an intermediary like a government, bank or another third party. The transactions are maintained by a network of computers in a way that makes it difficult to hack or alter.\n\nCrypto and blockchain industries are becoming more and more popular with the millennials and Gen-Z generations. But investing in crypto and being a crypto influencer are two different things. Anyone can invest in the cryptocurrency market, but without proper knowledge, it is very hard to succeed.\n\nBelow, we have listed the names of four crypto investors/advisors who have come from very different backgrounds, but after gathering immense knowledge and experience over the years, they have started their own Cryptocurrency platform, Crypque.\n\nABHISHEK BHANDARI\n\nAbhishek Bhandari is the CMO of CRYPQUE, a Crypto, Web 3.0 & Blockchain tech company.

He started in the stock market a few years back and made some heavy losses until he received guidance from Abhishek Bhandari. Slowly, he ramped up and started making more profits than ever before. He has a skilled mastership in Business Planning, Entrepreneurship, Organizational Leadership, Team Leadership, and Business Intelligence. He has pursued B. Com in Computer Applications from DAV College and MBA in Financial and Marketing Management from Kurukshetra University.\n\nSIDDHARTH SHUKLA\n\nHe has completed his B.

        "title": "Is Cryptocurrency The New Normal?",
        "description": "10 years back, if anyone said that cryptocurrency would be more sought after rather than normal banks, no one would have believed it.\n\nBut today, that same statement has come true. In fact, it is much more popular than anyone could have imagined even a few years back.\n\nBitcoin was started in the year 2009 at the value of US $0.0008. Today, the market price of Bitcoin stands at US $28,108. Moreover, there is only approx. 2 million\n\nBitcoin left to mine from the 21 million Bitcoin limit.\n\nAnd today, Bitcoin is not the only coin that is circulating in the world. Some other few cryptocurrencies with highest market capitalisation are:\n\na) Ethereum: US $216 billion\n\nb) Tether: US $66 billion\n\nc) Binance: US $52 billion\n\nd) USD Coin: US $54 billion\n\ne) Cardano: US $18 billion\n\nEven in India, there are millions of people who prefer to invest in cryptocurrency rather than stashing money in a bank. With the current financial crunch in the banks, the popularity of cryptocurrency has increased. Even the government is now recognising the digital currency as a form of legalised tender, El Salvador being the first country to do so. The Government of India did not approve the legalisation of cryptocurrency yet, but allows people to invest in it as long as they carry a digital wallet.\n\nWith time, cryptocurrency is being accepted by various merchants and the payment processes are getting easier. People can now pay in crypto using UPI- similar to Google Pay, Paytm, etc. One of the companies that is introducing this in India is Crypque, an Indian based Blockchain and Web 3.0 company. They are launching a mobile application called CRYP, where people can use cryptocurrency for exchange, utility services, ecommerce, games, lottery, and payment for merchants. This will be an all-in-one platform where all payments can be made using cryptocurrency. The platform is expected to blow up since the popularity of cryptocurrency is increasing so much that in the next few years, people will prefer crypto over traditional currency.",

        "title": "Citi Digital Money Symposium: Global standardisation of cryptoassets is critical",
        "description": "Citi\u2019s Digital Money Symposium brought together experts and businesses in the industry to explore trends and future developments in the digital money market.\n\nHow valuable is blockchain?\n\n\n\nIn the panel \u2018Money, Tokens, and Games: Blockchain\u2019s Next Billion Users and Trillions in Value\u2019 interesting points were raised by Dr. Ruth Wandhofer, a partner at Gauss Ventures, who spoke on how developments in digital identity need to be made so that customers can retake control over their data at their own volition, rather than relying on algorithms to curate their online experiences.\n\nRonit Ghose, global head of future of finance and digital at Citi Global Insights, defined the term \u2018disruptive technology\u2019, explaining that disruption comes from the margins rather than the big players in the industry. He used e-commerce and online instant payments as an example, stating that AliPay came up with a solution to a problem in the payments system \u2013 they were not an incumbent looking to revolutionise the industry, but they did.\n\nAaron Powers, co-founder and CEO of Hunit, added that the rise of smart contracts is a major contributor to digital identity.\n\nBecks Perfect, founder, Nifty World NFT, noted that the rise of individual digital identities will give the customers and online creators more control over their own data which will completely transform the creator economy and shift away from the dominance of social media.\n\nPerfect explained that gaming is an emerging industry, especially in East Asia, and this will become more prevalent as it continues to adopt Web 3.0 technologies. However, the adoption of gaming will rely on how quickly it evolves, therefore it will not be a rapid rise but a slow climb.\n\nCan digital asset frameworks be efficient?\n\n\n\nA panel of experts discussed the progress of digital asset frameworks in the next session \u2018Building the Institutional Digital Asset Infrastructure\u2019. The panelists were all working on technologies that are pioneering developments in digital currency.\n\nJens Hachmeister, managing director of issuer services and new digital markets at Deutsche Borse, stated that the digital securities industry is approaching the market from too much of a technology standpoint, where instead they should be targeting efficiency in the market.\n\nAdrien Treccani, founder and CEO of Metaco, explained the tenets of the blockchain industry: \u201cWe have to remember how blockchain and Bitcoin was invented. It was invented for decentralisation. Therefore, there is so much cryptography into it because the idea was to put the coins directly in the hands of the user to avoid any form of identification application. The best way to have a systemic protection and to avoid systemic risks in to avoid banks, because if you can avoid banks through mobile hotspots, it will concentrate all of the wealth and you probably won't need institutional custody.\u201d\n\nTongtong Gong, COO at Amberdata, expressed that it is hard for financial firms to build digital asset infrastructure due to a lack of understanding of the fundamentals on how decentralised the data is, the market risks, and expertise when it comes to smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle that institutions need to overcome when it comes to digital assets is lack of access to transparent, yet distorted data,\u201d Gong stated.\n\nIsabella Chase, senior policy advisor at TRM Labs, observed the significance of interoperability between transaction chains, as there is a prominent financial crime issue in the adoption of blockchain. She adds that different tools need to be developed in the ecosystem to confront these challenges for organisations to understand the modes of how digital assets operate.\n\nHachmeister noted that data integrity is critical especially in context of legacy: \u201cTalking about transparency, identities, data integrity, not only within a kind of distributed system, but every at the kind of edge towards legacy that will be another critical factor. We have the we have the decentralised identities, transparency, zero knowledge proofs, and more, then you have the traditional world. To a certain extent, we need to synchronise data integrity. This is bigger than anything when it comes to solutions, which doesn't typically go above and beyond only one part of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add that data is critical in producing assets in the future and that the developments around crypto are a huge catalyst to generate revenues moving forward.\n\nDecentralised technology such as blockchain is slow to evolve, but once it reaches the point where it is efficient and active, then it creates a community of both retail and institutional users, explained Treccani.\n\nHe continued that the next steps are not de-fi or tokenisation, but how the protocols are being addressed and satisfied. How will institutions build on this technology, transform compliance, and make trades and settlements? The level of complexity will be increased, and the management must evolve alongside the ecosystem.\n\nFinishing the panel with the question, \u201cIf you had the funding to create a startup, what industry would you focus on?\u201d, the panellists each had their own take on what the future holds for digital currencies. Treccani talked about AI, the next big disruption in the digital asset industry, and various forms of decentralisation, while in contrast Hachmeister stated that it is now the time for incumbents as consumers are looking for trusted institutions, therefore he would not invest in a startup.\n\nGong closed by saying that she would have done what she did the first time with Amberdata, as while she was worried about being slow to the movement the first time around, there is still many advancements to be made in the digital assets sector.\n\nIn the next interactive session, the audience was able to see and hear from people in the metaverse, in which experts spoke on the collaboration and new developments emerging for NFTs and online applications of VR. Jacob Loewenstein, SVP of BD and strategy at Spatial, spoke from the metaverse on the extents of the space from gamified experiences and online sharing platforms, and Dave Starling, head of emerging technologies at Citi Innovation Labs, explained how banks are currently exploring the metaverse as a possible space for people to meet and interact in order to offset carbon footprints.\n\nHow will defining digital assets facilitate regulatory action?\n\n\n\nDuring the \u2018Regulating Digital Assets\u2019 session, the panellists discussed the constant swirl of news circulating in the digital assets sector and how regulation is looking stabilise the market.\n\nNicole Sandler, head of digital policy at Barclays, explained that digital assets are classified in a variety of ways by different regulatory authorities. She cites that a calling digital assets a \u2018currency\u2019 is inconsistent as there is no set price for digital assets, which is why CBDCs are not considered cryptocurrencies by regulators.\n\nOn crypto policy in the UK, Monica Sah, partner at Clifford Chance, stated that there is limited regulation beyond AML. \u201cWhere we are going is the interesting question I think,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil about two months ago, I would say that we weren't going far. There was a very purposeful approach to incremental regulatory regulation in the UK. The focus was twofold, initially in 2021 and 2020 to early 2022 was about regulating crypto marketing; bringing the marketing of those assets into the regulatory regime for the protection of retail investors because of scams.\u201d\n\nSah continued that looking to regulate stablecoins is important for market stability and there are new comprehensive cryptoasset policies coming to the UK, such as licencing regimes and the definition of cryptoassets.\n\nIjeoma Okoli, director of the Digital Economy Initiative commented on what developments are happening in the US, explaining that there is political cover for regulatory bodies to act under the Biden Administration, but the developments and bills need to be drafted in Congress. However, the SEC is going after the crypto sector, but along with the downfall of Binance\u2019s there are several new developments in the industry that is slowing down the process.\n\nOkoli explained that there is no timeline for the development of crypto policy, but there is a securities routine that is being implemented. On the definition of various cryptocurrencies, she clarified that Bitcoin is not considered a security, but a commodity, and the CTFC and SEC are unresolved on if Ethereum is a commodity or a security.\n\n\u201cIn relation to all the bills that were proposed relating to stablecoins relating to the dividing line between the SEC and the CFTC, for those who don't know, there is this current quiet battle going on between the commodities regulator and the securities regulators to have the vast majority of regulating the sector. Both the CFTC and the SEC obviously want it and they have been going after this sector aggressively,\u201d said Okoli.\n\nSandler observed the rapid growth of crypto and the diversity of digital assets and how they are defined: \u201cI think the role of the global standard setter is really valuable. When I first started doing panels on this topic, I said there are 300 different types of crypto assets. Last week, I said there's more than 19,000. Today we'll say there's more than 20,000 different crypto assets. What that means is they're not all created equally. They've got different use cases. The definition we rendered earlier is really, really important because if you don't know what you're regulating, how do you regulate it? What would be really valuable in the global standard setters is helping with a global taxonomy.\u201d\n\nProfessor Lawrence Deju-Wiseman, director at PwC Forensic Services detailed that he does not believe that there will be global cohesion in cryptocurrency. He stated that is not an issue, but there should be global cohesion on a uniform on the framework used.",

ShellBoxes offers numerous services; decentralized application (DApp) auditing, smart contract development and auditing, and Dapp development as well.

The ShellBoxes team employed both manual and automated testing to detect errors in logic and to broaden the scope of security assessment, respectively. After in-depth testing, the team discovered vulnerabilities that were expeditiously resolved to prevent exploitation.\n\nShellBoxes also reviewed and subsequently audited Kommunitas\u2019 V3 Staking contract to dispel vulnerabilities that could compromise the project\u2019s security. Additionally, the team reviewed and audited CapFinance, Unicrypt, DefySwap, Star Atlas, and Naos Finance smart contracts.\n\nAbout ShellBoxes\n\nShellBoxes is a leading web 3.0 company with a focus on providing quality blockchain security and development services.

        "title": "The Best 5 Alternative Crypto Tokens To ApeCoin (APE)",
        "description": "NFTs have been making waves in the cryptocurrency industry over the past year, and ApeCoin has emerged as one of the most popular platforms for NFT trading. Experts believe that ApeCoin is among a select group of tokens that could see stratospheric rises in 2023 and beyond.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to be aware that there are other options out there when it comes to investing in NFTs. These alternatives may offer better returns than ApeCoin or may provide more advantageous features such as liquidity or lower fees. In this article we will look at some of these possible alternatives so you can decide if they might be a better option for your investments than Apecoin.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start by looking at why many investors are turning towards NFT platforms like Apecoin to invest their money right now: Non-fungible tokens (NFT) allow users to create unique digital collectibles like artwork or game items which can then be traded on an open blockchain platform like Ethereum with anyone else who has access to the network. This gives buyers and sellers lots of freedom when it comes to finding trades \u2013 something which traditional markets simply cannot match up with due to restrictions from various centralised organisations such as banks or governments.\n\nFurthermore, some NFT projects use cutting edge technology such as smart contracts which automate certain processes meaning transactions happen faster and smoother than ever before \u2013 plus fees tend to be much lower compared with those charged by traditional institutions too! All these factors make NFT trading incredibly attractive right now but what other options exist?\n\nApeCoin (APE)\n\nApeCoin (APE) is the native token of the APE ecosystem, a revolutionary layer of protocol that supports community building in the Web 3.0 era. It is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 1 billion tokens, governed and built upon by the decentralized ApeCoin DAO. Yuga Labs, creator of popular NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), CryptoPunks and Meebits, has adopted APE as its primary token for all new products and services.\n\nUpon launch of ApeCoin, holders of BAYC and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were given collective access to 15% of the total supply (150 million tokens). The APE Foundation serves as legal steward for those partaking in governance decisions via the DAO. The Board consists primarily of 5 members from tech & crypto backgrounds; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian included among them. These initial Board members will serve 6 month terms before being voted on annually by APE holders themselves. With every participant within its growing ecosystem comprising users who hold onto their coins or use them for various transactions \u2013 be it voting or engaging with products & services \u2013 APE works to facilitate growth and development in a fair and inclusive manner.\n\nFor those looking to make a smart investment, TOADS is the ideal choice. It\u2019s a high-growth, deflationary memecoin that offers investors a fun and compelling P2E model alongside next-level NFT staking capabilities.

Anchor, a high-yielding savings and lending protocol introduced by Terra, makes up more than half of its total value locked. Although it remains to be seen whether other use cases will arise if Anchor should fail to sustain itself, this crypto asset is certainly gaining traction at an impressive rate.\n\nMetropoly (METRO)\n\nMetropoly is revolutionizing the crypto world by introducing a new way to invest in real estate: tokenizing properties into NFTs, with blockchain technology. This allows investors of any size to buy fractionalized assets such as villas and beach houses for as little as $100 \u2013 all without hidden fees or geographic restrictions.

However, there are other alternatives out there that could provide better returns for investors than ApeCoin does. DigiToads (TOADS) and FGHT are two such options worth considering if you\u2019re looking to get a good return on your investment in an NFT platform. It\u2019s important to do your research before investing any money into an NFT project or platform. You should weigh up the pros and cons of each option carefully so you can make an informed decision about where to put your money and how best to manage risks associated with them. Investing in new technologies like this can be risky, but if done right it can pay off handsomely \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen from the recent surge in prices of many digital artworks created using NFT technology over the last year or so!\n\nFor More Information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community",

        "title": "Web3.0: The Next Frontier of the Internet",
        "description": "The internet has matured dramatically over the past few decades, from the early days of dial-up connections and static websites to the dynamic, interconnected world we know today. And yet, as we enter the third decade of the 21st century, we are on the cusp of another revolution in internet technology: the rise of Web 3.0.\n\nThis new paradigm promises to change the way we engage with information, each other, and the world around us in ways that are difficult to comprehend fully. In this article, we\u2019ll explore what Web 3.0 is, how it differs from its predecessors, and the potential impact it could have on society.\n\nWhat is Web 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 is often cited as the decentralized web, and it represents a fundamentally different approach to the internet than its predecessors. Web 1.0 was characterized by static HTML pages that were difficult to update, while Web 2.0 introduced dynamic content, social media, and the rise of mobile devices. Web 3.0 builds on these advancements by taking advantage of blockchain technology, which allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that are not controlled by any single entity.\n\nOne of the key functionalities of Web 3.0 is the concept of decentralization, which refers to the lack of a central authority controlling the network. Instead, dApps are built on top of decentralized protocols that are maintained by a network of nodes, each contributing to the overall security and functionality of the network. This makes it much more difficult for any single entity to manipulate or control the network, creating a more open and transparent system.\n\nAnother key aspect of Web 3.0 is the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that are coded into the blockchain. This allows for a wide range of new applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to decentralized social networks, that can operate without the need for intermediaries like banks or social media companies.\n\nPotential Impact of Web 3.0\n\nThe potential impact of Web 3.0 on society is difficult to overstate. Here are just a few ways that it could change the world:\n\n1. Empowering individuals\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Web 3.0 is that it puts more power into the hands of individuals. Instead of relying on centralized authorities to control information or manage transactions, individuals can take control of their own data and participate in decentralized networks. This could have significant implications for everything from finance to social media, as individuals become more empowered to make their own decisions and control their own destinies.\n\n2. Reducing inequality\n\nDecentralization could also help to reduce inequality by creating more opportunities for people to participate in the global economy. Without the need for intermediaries, costs could be reduced, and access to services could be expanded, creating a more level playing field for everyone.\n\n3. Improving transparency\n\nThe decentralized nature of Web 3.0 also means that there is greater transparency and accountability built into the system. Because no single entity controls the network, it is more difficult for any one group to manipulate information or data. This could have significant implications for everything from politics to finance, where transparency and accountability are often lacking.\n\n4. Creating new business models\n\nWeb 3.0 could also create entirely new business models that are not possible with centralized systems. For example, decentralized marketplaces could allow for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, while decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could allow for more democratic decision-making within organizations.\n\n5. Enabling new applications\n\nFinally, Web 3.0 will enable a wide range of new applications that are not possible with centralized systems. From decentralized social networks to decentralized finance, the possibilities are endless. This could create new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship.",

        "title": "What is Web 3.0?",
        "description": "Web 3.0, as the name itself suggests, is the emerging phase or the latest phase of the evolution of the internet. Web 3 or Web 3.0, is based on the concept of creating a totally decentralized ecosystem. This new technological dimension believes in leveraging the power of A.I., machine learning, and the latest technologies like blockchain to solve the problems of the present-day internet/online ecosystem.\n\nHow is Web 3.0 going to be different from the previous versions of the web?\n\nWeb 1.0 or the very first version of the internet was only a basic read-only version of the internet. It did not allow much functionality or flexibility to the users. The users were only allowed to read information from the websites. The second generation of the internet, or Web 2.0, i.e. the stage of the internet that we are at right now allowed a bit more flexibility. Web 2.0 gave the users the flexibility not only to read but also to write, upload, send & receive various forms of content \u2013 text, image & video, via the internet. So, Web 3.0 is bound to be better and much more advanced than the internet that we are used to today.\n\nIn other words, Web 3.0 refers to a new, improved, and democratized, internet ecosystem which will be free from any sort of central authority. Using blockchain technology Web 3.0 can transform the way we use the internet. It has the potential to open up a whole new dimension of the internet. People will be able to buy, own, sell and earn by selling their digital content in the form of NFTs. Once Web 3.0 is widely accepted, various uses of blockchain technology like smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps\u2019), will become more popular.\n\nWhat will be the primary features of Web 3.0?\n\nThe basic idea behind the concept of Web 3.0 is to make the internet a smarter place. This new era of the web will make the internet more responsive, intelligent, and capable of giving a more satisfying and tailored experience to the user. It will totally transform the way we know or use the internet today. In order to understand the possible changes that we might see in Web 3.0 we would need to know the following four main pillars/features of Web 3.0:\n\nArtificial Intelligence \u2013 One of the primary features of Web 3.0 will be its ability to decipher human emotions and thoughts. Artificial Intelligence or AI will be used extensively to filter data and content and to tailor the search results according to the user\u2019s preference.\n\nSemantic Web \u2013 Semantics is the study of the linkages between words. The semantic web would enable the computer to analyze data and decode the meaning and emotions that they are trying to convey. This will help in giving a better and more pleasing internet usage experience to the users.\n\nUbiquity \u2013 Ubiquity means the power to be present everywhere at the same time, or in simpler words, ubiquity means omnipresence. Now Web 2.0 or the internet as we know it today is already quite omnipresent. So Web 3.0 will simply take it a step further by making the internet more widely accessible using the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n3D Graphics \u2013 Web 3.0 will bring in the new graphics technology, making the three-dimensional virtual world a reality. The use of 3D graphics will make the internet user experience more immersive and will also be helpful in transforming a variety of sectors like health, e-commerce, real estate, etc.\n\nWhat role will blockchain technology play in Web 3.0?\n\nWell as far as improving the internet and increasing its efficiency is concerned, Web 3.0 powered by blockchain technology can really be helpful in many ways. Using blockchain technology the speed of transactions can improve to astonishing levels. From 7 transactions per second (TPS) with Bitcoin in the initial days to 50000 TPS with Solana today, blockchain technology can really transform the course of the future of the internet and how we are accustomed to using it. If used properly, blockchain technology can help improve not only the digital transaction sector but also the digital health care sector, supply chain sector, and many other important sectors in the market. Blockchain technology can also redefine the way we are used to seeing social media sites.\n\nHowever, despite all the big promises that Web 3.0 and blockchain technology have, the implementation and adoption of these technologies in real-life scenarios will take a lot more time than we can expect. Blockchain technology, like any other technology, has a few drawbacks of its own. Thus implementing the blockchain technology in the mainstream will be a bit of a challenge, until and unless the associated problems have been dealt with. The way Web 3.0 will be adopted in the mainstream and what changes it will bring to the way we are used to is only for the time to table. But one thing is for sure the future of the internet is bound to be interesting.",

        "title": "What Is Web 3.0? Everything You Need to Know About Web 3.0",
        "description": "Web 3.0 has the potential to be just as disruptive and to usher in a significant paradigm shift as Web 2.0 did. The fundamental ideas of decentralization, openness and increased consumer usefulness form the foundation of Web 3.0. Web 3.0, often known as Web 3, is the next step in the development of the internet.\n\nImagine a new kind of Internet that accurately translates what you type and understands what you say, whether through text, voice, or other media, and where all of the content you consume is more personalized than ever before. In the evolution of the Internet, you are about to enter a new era. It's been termed Web 3.0.\n\nBut, exactly what is Web 3.0, how will it look, and how will it affect our lives? If you\u2019re curious to know the above, you have reached the right place. In this tutorial, you will get all the answers to your questions related to Web 3.0.\n\nProfessional Certificate Program in Blockchain in Collaboration with IIT Kanpur Enroll Now\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0 Technology?\n\nIt is anticipated that Web 3.0 will be:-\n\nOpen - Open-source software will be used to build content platforms.\n\nTrustless - Everyone will use Zero Trust, and network protection will reach the edge.\n\nDistributed - Interaction between devices, users, and services will be possible without a centralized authority's approval.\n\nBlockchain technology will make it possible for users to communicate directly with one another throughout the next stage of the internet. Users will communicate by becoming a part of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a group that is run and owned by its community.\n\nData belonging to the user will be protected via a network of openly available smart contracts. These contracts will be stored in a blockchain, which a decentralized network that nodes will control.\n\nThe following are further Web 3 forecasts:\n\nAll transactions will be tracked on a distributed ledger that uses blockchain technology, and data transfers will be decentralized.\n\nSmart contracts that are open to everyone will relieve people of the need to rely on a centralized organization (like a bank) to maintain data integrity.\n\nThe entertainment sector will significantly increase its revenue from the metaverse.\n\nBlockchain technology will make it possible for consumers to instantly produce digital goods and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which will protect intellectual property and personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nUsers' data will be able to be profited from.\n\nWhat Is Web 3.0?\n\nTim Berners-Lee, a developer who created the WWW or World Wide Web, originally referred to Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web and saw an intelligent, self-sufficient, and open Internet that employed AI and machine learning to function as a \"global brain\" and interpret content conceptually and contextually.\n\nDue to technological constraints, such as how expensive and challenging it is to translate human language into machine understandable language, this idealized version didn't quite work out.\n\nFollowing is a list of typical Web 3.0 traits:\n\nThe semantic web is a development in online technology that enables people to produce, share, and connect material through search and analysis. Instead of using numbers and keywords, it is centered on word understanding.\n\nIt uses machine learning and artificial intelligence. The final result is the formation of Web 3.0 to grow smarter and more receptive to user demands. If these ideas are paired with Natural Language Processing (NLP), the result is a computer that uses NLP.\n\nIt illustrates how the Internet of Things connects various devices and applications (IoT). This procedure is made possible by semantic metadata, allowing for the efficient exploitation of all available data. In addition, anyone can access the internet from anywhere at any time without a computer or other smart device.\n\nIt gives users a choice to interact in public or in private without exposing them to dangers through a third party, providing \"trustless\" data.\n\n3-D graphics are used. In fact, this is already evident in e-commerce, virtual tours, and computer gaming.\n\nIt makes participation easier without requiring consent from a ruling entity. It's without authorization.\n\nIt is applicable to:\n\nMetaverses: A limitless, virtual environment that is 3D-rendered\n\nBlockchain video games adhere to the NFTs' ideals by enabling users to possess actual ownership of in-game resources.\n\nDigital infrastructure and privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs and more secure personal data are used in this application.\n\nFinancial decentralization. Peer-to-peer digital financial transactions, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies are examples of this use.\n\nAutonomous decentralized organizations. Online communities are owned by the community.\n\nWhat Is Web 2.0?\n\nIf Web 1.0 consisted of a small group of individuals producing material for a bigger audience, Web 2.0 consists of many individuals producing even more content for an expanding audience. Web 2.0 places more emphasis on participation and contribution than Web 1.0 did on reading.\n\nUser-Generated Content (UGC), usability, interaction, and enhanced connectivity with other systems and devices are the main focuses of this Internet form. In Web 2.0, the experience of the user is everything. As a result, this Web form was in charge of establishing social media, collaborations, and communities. Web 2.0 is therefore regarded as the dominant method of web interaction for the majority of users in today's world.\n\nWeb 2.0 is described as \"the participative social Web,\" whereas Web 1.0 was referred to as \"the read-only Web.\" With the incorporation of web browser technologies like JavaScript frameworks, Web 2.0 is an improved and expanded version of its predecessor.\n\nThe typical traits of Web 2.0 are broken down as follows:\n\nIt includes dynamic content that reacts to user input\n\nIt uses developed application programming interfaces (API)\n\nIt encourages self-use and allows forms of interaction like podcasting, social media, tagging, blogging, commenting, curating with RSS, social networking, and web content voting\n\nIt offers free information sorting, allowing users to retrieve and classify data collectively\n\nIt employs developed application programming interfaces (API)\n\nIt uses developed information; it is used by society as a whole and is not just specific communities.\n\nGet the Coding Skills You Need to Succeed Full Stack Development-MEAN Explore Program\n\nThe Difference Between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0\n\nWeb 1.0 Web 2.0 Web 3.0 Despite only providing limited information and little to no user interaction, it was the first and most reliable internet in the 1990s. Because of developments in web technologies such as Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, etc., and Web 2.0 made the internet a lot more interactive. Web 3.0 is the next break in the evolution of the Internet, allowing it to understand data in a human-like manner. Before, there was no such thing as user pages or just commenting on articles. Social networks and user-generated content production have flourished because data can now be distributed and shared. It will use AI technology, Machine Learning, and Blockchain to provide users with smart applications. Consumers struggled to locate valuable information in Online 1.0 since there were no algorithms to scan through websites. Many web inventors, including the above-mentioned Jeffrey Zeldman, pioneered the set of technologies used in this internet era. This will enable the intelligent creation and distribution of highly tailored content to every internet user.\n\nKey Features of Web 3.0\n\nAlthough Web 3.0 has not yet been given a formal definition, it does have several distinguishing characteristics: -\n\nDecentralization: A fundamental principle of Web 3.0. In Web 2.0, computers search for data that is kept at a fixed location, typically on a single server, using HTTP in the form of distinct web addresses. Information might be stored simultaneously in numerous locations and become decentralized with Web 3.0 since it would be found based on its content rather than a single location. This would give individuals more power by dismantling the enormous databases that internet goliaths like Meta and Google presently maintain.\n\nWith Web 3.0, users will be able to sell their own data through decentralized data networks, ensuring that they maintain ownership control. This data will be produced by various powerful computing resources, such as mobile phones, desktop computers, appliances, automobiles, and sensors.\n\nDecentralization and open source software-based Web 3.0 will also be trustless (i.e., participants will be able to interact directly without going via a trusted intermediary) and permissionless (meaning that each individual can access without any governing body's permission). This means that Web 3.0 applications\u2014also known as dApps\u2014will operate on blockchains, decentralized peer-to-peer networks, or a hybrid of the two \u2014such decentralized apps are referred to as dApps.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning: With the help of the Semantic Web and natural language processing-based technologies, Web 3.0 will enable machines to comprehend information similarly to humans. Web 3.0 will also make use of machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics human learning by using data and algorithms, gradually improving its accuracy. Instead of just targeted advertising, which makes up the majority of present efforts, these capabilities will result in faster and more relevant outcomes in a variety of fields like medical development and new materials.\n\nConnectivity and ubiquity: With Web 3.0, content and information are more accessible across applications and with a growing number of commonplace devices connected to the internet. The Internet of Things is one such example.\n\nFREE Course: Blockchain Developer Learn Blockchain Basics with the FREE Course Enroll Now\n\nLayers of Web 3.0\n\nWeb 3.0 is propelled by four new layers of technological innovation:\n\nEdge Computing - While web 2.0 changed currently commoditized personal computer technology in data centers, web 3.0 pushes the data center out to the edge (i.e. edge computing) and into our hands. Decentralized Data Network - Users will own their data on web 3.0 since data is decentralized. Different data generators can sell or share their data without losing ownership or relying on intermediaries using decentralized data networks. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have advanced to the level that they can now make useful and occasionally life-saving predictions and acts. Blockchain - Blockchain is a decentralized technology that uses smart contracts to execute transactions. These smart contracts define the semantics of a web 3.0 application. As a result, everyone who wants to develop a blockchain application must use the shared state machine.\n\nHow Does Web 3.0 Work?\n\nYour information is stored on your cryptocurrency notecase in web3. On web3, you'll interact with apps and communities through your wallet, and when you log off, you'll take your data with you. Since you are the owner of the data, you may theoretically choose whether to monetize it.\n\nWith our guiding principles established, we can start looking at how certain web3 development features are meant to accomplish these objectives.\n\nData ownership: When you use a platform like Facebook or YouTube, these businesses gather, own, and recoup your data. Your data is stored on your cryptocurrency wallet in web3. On web3, you'll interact with apps and communities through your wallet, and when you log off, you'll take your data with you. Since you are the owner of the data, you may theoretically choose whether to monetize it.\n\nPseudonymity: Privacy is a feature of your wallet, just as data ownership. Your wallet serves as your identification on web3, which makes it difficult to connect it to your actual identity. Therefore, even if someone can observe the activity of a wallet, they won't be able to identify your wallet. \"My personal information is hidden, but my behavior is visible.\" It was quoted by Neuroth.\n\nThere are services that help customers connect to their cryptocurrency wallets used for illegal behavior. However, your identity is concealed for daily use.\n\nAlthough wallets increase the level of privacy for bitcoin transactions, privacy coins like Zcash and Monero give transactions total anonymity. Blockchains for privacy coins allow observers to track transactions, but they are unable to view the wallets involved.\n\nWeb3 will feature decentralized autonomous entities running apps (DAOs). As a result, decisions are no longer made by a centralized authority but rather by users who own governance tokens, which may be acquired by taking part in the maintenance of these decentralized programmes or by purchasing them.\n\nIn a typical corporation, the CEO is responsible for implementing changes approved by the shareholders. Token holders in a DAO can vote on modifications that, if approved, are immediately incorporated into the DAO's code via a smart contract. Everyone gets access to the source code of a DAO since they are democratized.\n\nHow Will Web 3.0 Change Our Lives?\n\nDue to its decentralized nature, which is made possible by distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, Web 3.0 is intended to produce sustainable results. It also lowers costs by doing away with middlemen, manual mediation, and arbitration.\n\nFor everybody, Web 3.0 offers a much more individualized surfing experience. Websites will be able to automatically adjust to our device, location, and any accessibility needs we may have, and web apps will become far more receptive to our usage patterns.\n\nWe believe that the emergence of Web 3.0 will improve our lives for the following three reasons, which we believe are fairly appropriate:\n\n1. A More Customized Browsing Process\n\nThere is no denying the ease of being able to quickly click through to a particular offer for something you actually need or desire and that you would have missed otherwise, regardless of how intrusive those advertisements may occasionally feel.\n\n2. Improved search\n\nAs was already mentioned, using a search engine in natural language is highly effective. The benefits go far beyond the consumer as the learning curve virtually disappears, and businesses are increasingly able to optimize their websites for search engines in a more organic way as opposed to using complicated keyword techniques.\n\n3. More Advanced App Interfaces\n\nThe multidimensional Web 3.0 will help more than just websites; it will also enable web apps to provide users with far richer experiences. Consider a mapping service like Google, which can now include route planning, lodging suggestions, and real-time traffic updates in addition to the fundamentals of location search. Simply put, in the Web 2.0 age, this was not feasible.\n\nKey Applications of Web 3.0\n\nWith blockchain at its core, Web 3.0 makes it possible for an expanding range of new apps and services, such as the following:\n\nNFT: Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are tokens that are individually unique and are kept in a blockchain with a cryptographic hash.\n\nDeFi: Decentralized blockchain technology is being utilized as the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi), a new use case for Web 3.0 that allows for the provision of financial services beyond the constraints of conventional centralized banking infrastructure.\n\nCryptocurrency: A new universe of money that strives to be distinct from the traditional world of fiat cash is being created through Web 3.0 apps like cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\ndApp: Decentralized applications (dApps) are programmes that run programmatically and are logged in an immutable ledger. They are built on top of the blockchain and use smart contracts to facilitate service delivery.\n\nChain-crossing bridges: In the Web 3.0 age, there are numerous blockchains, and cross-chain bridges provide some kind of connectivity between them.\n\nDAOs: DAOs are poised to potentially take on the role of Web 3.0's governing bodies, offering some structure and decentralized governance.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Web 3.0\n\nAdvantages -\n\nIn terms of data security, end-users will benefit the most from data encryption.\n\nDue to decentralized data storage, users will be able to access data in any situation. Users will receive multiple backups that will aid them if the server crashes.\n\nMost blockchain systems are developed by non-profits, which provides an open-source blockchain platform that allows for collaborative design and development.\n\nThe data will be provided from any location and on any device.\n\nWeb 3.0 is useful for problem-solving and heavy knowledge-generation tasks.\n\nDisadvantages -\n\nTo make the technology accessible to more people worldwide, the devices' capabilities and qualities will need to be expanded.\n\nAny websites built on web 1.0 technology will become obsolete once web 3.0 is fully implemented on the Internet.\n\nWeb 3.0 technology is more intelligent, efficient, and accessible than in previous generations. However, the technology isn't quite ready for general use.\n\nWith easier access to a user's information and reduced privacy thanks to web 3.0, reputation management will be more important than ever.\n\nBlockchain Certification Training Course Gain expertise in core Blockchain concepts View Course\n\nThe Future of the Internet\n\nThe world is on its way to an Internet where people have complete control over their data and privacy while also allowing companies to exploit it (or not). All of this will be made possible by blockchain technology.\n\nAs a result, web 3.0 will hasten the fair and transparent use of user data, ranging from personalized search results to cross-platform development tools and 3D graphics. The internet will become more immersive and engaging in the next years.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. What are Web 3.0 tools?\n\nAI, semantic web, and omnipresent qualities may all be taken into consideration when designing Web 3.0. The rationale for AI stems from the need to give users faster access to more accurate data. An artificial intelligence (AI)-powered website ought to be able to sort through the data and present the information it thinks a particular visitor will find useful. Given that the results are websites that users have chosen, social bookmarking as a search engine can yield superior outcomes to Google. However, humans are also capable of manipulating these outcomes. In order to provide outcomes comparable to social media and social bookmarking but without negative feedback, AI could be used to differentiate the true results from the fakes.\n\nVirtual assistants, a component that is already becoming popular as an aspect integrated into a device or through third-party apps, will also be introduced by an artificially intelligent web.\n\nThe goal of the semantic web is to organize and store data in a way that can be used to teach a system what a given piece of information means. In order to create and distribute better content, a website should be able to comprehend the language in the same way humans comprehend. AI can process information into knowledge only if it comprehends the information.\n\n2. Is Web 3.0 the future of the internet?\n\nThe Web 3.0 leverages AI, Machine Learning and blockchain technology. It is expected to achieve real-world communication. Individuals will own the data, and they will be compensated for the time they spend on the internet. This sounds futuristic, and the data and privacy of the users will increase with the blockchain technology. Thus if all goes well, Web 3.0 will be the future of the internet.\n\n3. How do I create a Web 3.0 website?\n\nFirst, you need to buy an NFT domain name. Next, you can make a website. The thing to remember is that the website needs to be made in one of the three ways: -\n\nUse existing templates on website builders.\n\nHost the website on an InterPlanetary File System Protocol or IPFS.\n\nRedirect to an existing Web 3.0 Website.\n\n4. Why is Web 3.0 important?\n\nThe following are a few crucial aspects of Web 3.0 that help define what the third generation of the web is expected to be all about:\n\nDecentralized: Web 3.0 will be decentralized in contrast to the past two generations of the web, which had heavily centralized governance and applications. A distributed method without a centralized authority will enable applications and services.\n\nBlockchain-based: The development of decentralized applications and services is made possible by blockchain. In contrast to centralized database infrastructure, blockchain uses a distributed way to disseminate data and connections between services. In a decentralized environment, blockchain can also offer an immutable ledger of transactions and activities, assisting in the provision of verified authenticity.\n\nCryptocurrency-enabled: The use of cryptocurrencies, which primarily replaces the use of fiat money, is a key component of Web 3.0 services.\n\nArtificially intelligent and autonomous: A key aspect of Web 3.0 is more automation overall, which will mostly be driven by AI.\n\nDecipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain with the Blockchain Certification Training Course. Get trained today.\n\nConclusion\n\nWeb 3.0, sometimes known as Web 3, is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a decentralized network and have access to their own data. This article taught us about the technologies that are anticipated to advance and change in the upcoming years. Intelligent systems, semantic web, decentralization, metaverse, digital assets, and other emerging technologies will all be part of Web 3.0.\n\nWhether Web 3.0 will be successful or not needs to be seen. But one thing most analysts agree is that the demand for data security will be of prime importance. It follows that there would be a great need for security specialists and security-related systems. Also the demand for blockchain developers will increase.

        "title": "Web 3.0 doesn\u2019t need a blockchain revolution",
        "description": "Web 3.0, or Web3 if you prefer, refers to a new web paradigm that promises to make the internet fairer and more secure by putting users in charge of their own data and identities. Web 3.0 promises to empower all of us with unprecedented levels of control over, and visibility into, how our data is used.\n\nTo Web 3.0 evangelists, this revolution is achieved via a fully \u201cdecentralized\u201d internet built on blockchain. Needless to say, this is a departure from all of the existing constructs of the web.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not reasonable to expect everyone to throw away what they currently have and start over. After all, what we have is pretty good at a lot of things. We need to shift the paradigm, not overhaul it. Instead of a revolution, what we need is an evolution of the web as we know it, to enable the capabilities promised by Web 3.0: security, privacy, consent, user-centricity, interoperability, and more.\n\nAs currently considered, the Web 3.0 promise is missing something\u2014namely, the logical next step toward a better internet. This logical next step has been provided by the originator of the web himself, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nA practical step toward a better internet\n\nIn order to disentangle the promise of Web 3.0 from the implementation details of blockchain, it helps to consider what people actually want out of the next era of the web.\n\nWhat many of us want is visibility, choice, and a reasonable degree of control over our data. We require the ability to know who has access to our data, to know how our data is being used, and to decline consent if we\u2019re not comfortable with sharing certain data. Perhaps most importantly, we want our data to be used for our benefit.\n\nBlockchain can help with these goals in certain cases. Because blockchain is a protocol for reading and writing data in a decentralized and immutable way, it can help make the ownership and historical integrity of data easier to manage and access. Certain finance, supply chain, and chain of custody use cases are perfect fits for blockchain as a result.\n\nBut there are many more technical capabilities required for Web 3.0 solutions to deliver visibility, choice, and control over data. In order to build Web 3.0 apps that are fast and flexible, we need a tech stack with solutions for identity, data management, application interoperability, access control, and consent.\n\nFortunately, solutions to these requirements already exist in the form of emerging web standards and technologies, including those encapsulated in Solid, Berners-Lee\u2019s new system for organizing data, applications, and identities on the web. Let\u2019s look closer at these requirements and what complete solutions need to look like.\n\nWeb 3.0 must rely on identity and access control\n\nWhat most people want and need is visibility, transparency, and consent over their data. In particular, individuals need guarantees around confidentiality between themselves and trusted parties, partners, and institutions. For example, my medical records are between me and my doctor. My finances are between me, my financial institution, and my accountant. Whenever more than one party requires access to data, we need a robust and unambiguous access control system to manage confidentiality\u2014not a public ledger of who owns which data point.\n\nThese types of flexible data relationships require identities on the web that are not tied to any particular vendor or application. Solutions such as decentralized identifiers and web identifiers are already gaining traction in this space, but the solutions must be finalized and integrated with the rest of the web stack. Fine-grained access controls are also required for an end-to-end solution. Accordingly, web standards are emerging that aim to provide simple privacy controls over user data. These standards are incorporated into Berners-Lee\u2019s Solid technology, which is designed to be an end-to-end solution for identity, applications, and data on the web\u2014all built around personal online datastores (Solid Pods).\n\nWhat would this look like in a Web 3.0 world? Today, when you install a new app on your smartphone, you will receive a notification requesting access to various classes of data stored on your device, such as your contacts, pictures, or location. You\u2019re given the option to grant that access or reject it, and you reserve the right to revoke access to those applications and services at any time in your privacy settings. A true Web 3.0 solution would bring this user experience to all of the data about you on the web, such as your financial records, medical data, browsing preferences, and ecommerce data, not just the data stored on your phone.\n\nWeb 3.0 applications must be interoperable\n\nThe web today is characterized by fragmented data. Every web user\u2019s data is scattered across countless organizations, each with its own silo. Nearly every company in the world struggles to capture a valid and consistently up-to-date, 360-degree view of its customers. Companies integrate numerous platforms and data warehouses to avoid data duplication, staleness, and decay.\n\nAll of this effort leads to incredibly complex infrastructure, which is a compliance and liability nightmare, and results in only a handful of companies having the resources to set themselves apart. This means that success continues to be determined by which companies can hoard the most data and not who delivers the best services.\n\nNew web technologies like Solid solve this problem by building on already widely adopted web standards to ensure interoperability at an application and protocol level. Building on these standards prevents lock-in for users and enterprises alike.\n\nApplication interoperability is necessary for organizations and people to work with each other seamlessly on the web. An interoperable data standard gives organizations a single authoritative source of truth while reducing operational overhead and simplifying infrastructure. Because each individual is empowered to control and update their own data within the framework, the information will be both accurate and up-to-date. Such a system also provides transparency and visibility into who has access to which data and what that data is being used for, which protects the individual\u2019s data privacy rights and complies with modern privacy legislation.\n\nWeb 3.0 must be distributed\n\nWith web-native solutions such as Solid, data is distributed. This means that regardless of where personal data is physically stored, it is connected to the person it describes, and the data is interoperable across systems. People are able to revoke access to most classes of data if they choose, but there is also support for cases where access must be granted to certain entities for compliance and governance reasons.\n\nDecentralization is an extremely popular concept with Web3 evangelists. But requiring physically decentralized storage does not always mesh well with organizations that require governance and compliance. For example, if regulatory compliance requires special measures to be taken to protect certain classes of data housed on servers, organizations will generally struggle to adopt blockchain (or any solution based on decentralized storage) because they will have no simple means of identifying and governing those different classes of data.\n\nIn addition, complete decentralization forces each individual to self-govern their data\u2014a situation most people don\u2019t want. Realistically, the majority of people do not have the knowledge and skills to do this effectively or safely, given the complexity of today\u2019s data ecosystems. Full self-governance leaves end-users and their data more at risk, defeating a central purpose of Web 3.0 and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI.\n\nBlockchain is an impressive technology that can be highly useful in specific contexts. But it does not provide the end-to-end capabilities needed to serve as the foundation for the next evolutionary phase of the web. Achieving the full promise of Web 3.0 will require Solid technologies and standards that enable interoperability and fine-grained access control within a distributed and compliant system. These capabilities serve to engender trust as people gain visibility, transparency, and consent over their data.\n\nThe logical next step toward a better web is for organizations to adopt this new infrastructure as the focal point of sharing critical data across their services and businesses\u2014enabling governance and seamless flow among internal systems, external partner organizations, and users. For enterprises and governments, the endless integrations and operational workarounds necessitated by data silos would give way to an architecture that synchronizes consent-based data between the user and the organization. This is the empowerment that Web 3.0 aspires to and the vision that Solid is working to make a reality.\n\nOsmar Olivo is VP of product management at Inrupt.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nNew Tech Forum provides a venue to explore and discuss emerging enterprise technology in unprecedented depth and breadth.

        "title": "Two Wrongs Don\u2019t Make A Right: Adventures In Multiplying Hype",
        "description": "In the quest for funding, entrepreneurs and hype artists often devolve into buzzwords, hoping that some magic combination of syllables will unlock the dragon\u2019s treasure. Sometimes it even works. When it does, it just sucks money out of investors\u2019 or governmental pockets, throws it into a whirling maw of incompetent or misguided engineers, and delivers nothing of any interest or value.\n\nWhat triggered this brief walkthrough is lots of euros being thrown at a supersonic hydrogen aircraft by the Spanish government, specifically the Ministry of Science\u2019s Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnol\u00f3gico e Industrial with the support of the Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial (INTA).\n\nAs a reminder, both faster than the speed of sound passenger travel and hydrogen for aviation are both in the sexy but impractical quadrant of my aviation and aerospace grid. Supersonic because there\u2019s a vanishingly small market for absurdly expensive and wasteful very high speed passenger travel for the 0.001%, and because Boom Supersonic is already failing miserably to deliver in that space despite almost $150 million in funding \u2014 about 100 times less than is required \u2014 with no one willing to build them an engine. And hydrogen because even NASA has serious challenges with liquid hydrogen, there\u2019s no world in which putting liquid hydrogen facilities on every major airport is remotely viable, and 20\u00b0 above absolute zero liquid hydrogen in the fuselage with warm-blooded human beings is uncertifiable.\n\nPutting them together does not make either one a good bet. It multiplies the inanity. It\u2019s intersectional foolishness. It\u2019s not like peanut butter and jam on toast, but more like Vegemite and potting soil on toast. Both Vegemite and potting soil are inedible, and putting them together doesn\u2019t make the combination nutritious or tasty.\n\nAdding two highly risky, very expensive, long-shot technologies together adds all of those big risks instead of mitigating any of them. But governments are just as susceptible to sexy stupidity as anybody else.\n\nSo the Spanish government has given two firms, Destinus and ITP Aero, stacks of money to do just that. How much? Almost $30 million in grants to build a hydrogen engine test facility near Madrid and do R&D of hydrogen supersonic engines.\n\nIs there any reason to believe that the money won\u2019t be wasted entirely? Does Destinus have an aerospace track record of delivering anything that would suggest that it can build a supersonic plane? Well, no, it\u2019s a Swiss startup that convinced seven credulous investors to give it about $29 million dollars in funding. What about ITP Aero? Well, it\u2019s actually a credible firm, a Rolls Royce subsidiary that was sold to Bain Capital and a couple of other organizations in 2022, with a history of making commercial and military aircraft engines.\n\nAmusingly, it appears that the Spanish government is giving lots of money to firms which aren\u2019t Spanish any more, although one of the minor partners, Sapa Placencia, is a Spanish firm that makes engines for eight-wheeled military vehicles. Yup, there\u2019s a synergistic technology partner for a hypersonic hydrogen commercial passenger aircraft.\n\nOf course, this is just one example of the intersectional foolishness in the hype-fueled funding world.\n\nAs I noted recently, three-wheeled higher speed electric vehicles are a dead end, not an amazing decarbonization or growth category. Aptera has an 18-year history of blowing $115 million in funding to produce nothing, and is currently undercapitalized by at least $280 million to just produce its initial promised run. It\u2019s desperately trying to find tens of millions more from credulous investors or governments to even be able to start manufacturing of a handful of their two-seater bubble trikes. So naturally, a couple of years ago they decided that it would be a great idea to add solar panels to their vaporware, so that people who were incompetent at basic math would be excited and they could find more credulous investors. And it succeeded a little bit.\n\nBut body-integrated solar panels powering electric cars is like a rubber band propeller powering a Dash 8, or giving everyone on a cruise ship a paddle and asking them to pitch in to get to Alaska. Electrical outlets are ubiquitous, cars get parked under trees, in garages of various types and in the shade a lot, and solar panels on them are never aligned with the sun. Added weight, added complexity, no juice. It makes no sense on sedans or SUVs which have much bigger square rooftops and hoods. Adding it to a rounded highway tricycle makes even less sense, although you wouldn\u2019t know it from a lot of the clickbait tech press.\n\nOf course, blockchain was big for a while, and still is in places, although it\u2019s a fundamentally limited technology that doesn\u2019t actually provide most of the benefits claimed for it. I can say that as in 2017 and 2018 I did a full architectural and value proposition analysis of most of the extant blockchain technologies, dove into their application in both healthcare and clean technology globally, was paid to co-author an initial coin offering whitepaper, published extensively, was the Canadian spokesperson for blockchain for a global technology firm and published a full report through CleanTechnica. As a note, after all of my efforts understanding blockchain, I invested exactly zero dollars in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut it still shows up. Many people haven\u2019t received the memo that blockchain is stale on the hype cycle, and that outside of financial technology plays where it often gets blended with Web 3.0 and the metaverse in an eyeball-rattling buzzword bingo trifecta, adding it to a technology pitch is a good way not to get taken seriously by people, but often a good way to once again get credulous investors to fork over money, which is pocketed by people involved while delivering nothing.\n\nPro-tip: if someone pitches you something which includes blockchain, ask them why it\u2019s a better choice than a Cloud-based database like MongoDB or Azure\u2019s SQL database. Odds are, they won\u2019t know. They\u2019ll be like the US right-wing author who wrote a book that was all about how being \u2018woke\u2019 was incredibly damaging to the US, but when recently asked on television to provide a simple definition of the term, failed miserably and humiliatingly for a couple of minutes. There are a couple of decent use cases for blockchain, but mostly it\u2019s just adding verbiage to pry open wallets.\n\nOne gravity energy storage firm has a tiny niche play that intends to reuse old mine shafts with huge ground-mounted winches to raise and lower big weights down the vertical main shaft. That might be the only viable non-pumped hydro gravity storage technology idea in existence, having run the numbers on multiple failures like Energy Vault. Where there are mines with big enough vertical shafts that are straight enough, deep enough, tectonically stable enough and unflooded, with a flat, hard rock surface at the top that is sufficient to support the absolutely massive winches, then a few locations could possibly pencil out for it.\n\nHowever, when they were communicating with me a few months ago, they told me that they were exploring, if memory serves, compressed air or hydrogen storage in the same abandoned mine, turning a simple, niche solution into a complex one with much poorer likelihood of viability. Compressed air works, although it has significant scaling and thermal management issues, and I consider it a niche technology as a result. Certain classes of underground hydrogen storage can be made to work, but old mines probably don\u2019t qualify simply because they are built to get rid of gases, not store them, and as a result locating all the sources of leakage in any abandoned mine big enough to be worth using would be a pain.\n\nUrban air mobility, where tilt-wing and tilt-rotor Jetsons fantasies buzz over cities and schoolyards, and are supposed to land on the top of converted parking garages and in soccer fields, is another area where inanities multiply. Recently an initiative local to me reached the first milestone of three years of wasting money in the space to date and published a report of their findings. It was a collaboration between the Vancouver Economic Commission (the Metro Vancouver body representing all the cities in the region) and the Canadian Advanced Air Mobility Consortium.\n\nThankfully, the results were toned down a lot from early documents I reviewed when I was tearing apart the SPAC-fueled, uncertifiable money pit a couple of years ago. The use cases in one document from the period pretended that there would be aerial buses flying regular routes, moving enough people around the 2.5 million population Lower Mainland that ground traffic congestion would be reduced, and that flying from downtown Vancouver to the airport would be a really great innovation, when we already have a rail link that gets there in a few minutes from downtown and carries more people in an hour than could possibly use air taxis in a year.\n\nHowever, the latest version has the same mixture as the hypersonic passenger jet that opened this piece. Yes, it leans into hydrogen as well, because nothing increases the safety of dangerously complex and unstable aircraft flying over schoolyards like adding lots of hydrogen to them.\n\nThat sells in BC, by the way, because my current home province is also the home of Ballard and hence a raft of fuel-cell and hydrogen firms, as well as having a lot of natural gas extraction and distribution. Hydrogen for energy hype is big here, so pitching the intersection of flying urban buzz saws with explosive hydrogen actually seems reasonable to a lot of credulous people locally.\n\nA useful way to think about technologies is that the simpler they can be made, the more likely they are to actually do something useful. One of Tesla\u2019s great advantages is its strong focus on reducing the components and complexity of their vehicles over time. The moving of virtually all knobs, dials and rocker switches in the cabin onto a flat-screen was aligned with that. The simplicity of an electric motor with one moving part is core to that. The avoidance of the lidar trap for its semi-autonomous features was part of that, although Tesla took it too far when it tried to remove radar too. If a firm is adding hyped complexity, they are aiming at credulous wallets, not deliverable solutions.\n\nI don't like paywalls. You don't like paywalls. Who likes paywalls? Here at CleanTechnica, we implemented a limited paywall for a while, but it always felt wrong \u2014 and it was always tough to decide what we should put behind there. In theory, your most exclusive and best content goes behind a paywall. But then fewer people read it! We just don't like paywalls, and so we've decided to ditch ours. Unfortunately, the media business is still a tough, cut-throat business with tiny margins. It's a never-ending Olympic challenge to stay above water or even perhaps \u2014 gasp \u2014 grow. So ...",
        "summary": "Adding two highly risky, very expensive, long-shot technologies together adds all of those big risks instead of mitigating any of them.\nSo the Spanish government has given two firms, Destinus and ITP Aero, stacks of money to do just that.\nAlmost $30 million in grants to build a hydrogen engine test facility near Madrid and do R&D of hydrogen supersonic engines.\nDoes Destinus have an aerospace track record of delivering anything that would suggest that it can build a supersonic plane?\nWell, no, it\u2019s a Swiss startup that convinced seven credulous investors to give it about $29 million dollars in funding.",

        "title": "Trace Network Labs\u2019 Fashion & Lifestyle Metaverse PARIZ introduces MetaCommerce aimed at bringing real adoptio",
        "description": "Over the past decade, the global consumer has systematically tilted towards online shopping that has changed buying behaviour overwhelmingly in favour of ecommerce. This trend, for all practical purposes, will continue for the times to come. Albeit, companies involved in the ecommerce have noticed that while customer outreach has increased, it has happened at the expense of human connection with their favourite brands.\n\nBrands across the spectrum are facing this problem and are now keen to somehow marry the online commerce genre with user experiences, which only Metaverse technologies can bring forth. Brands have now started exploring integrations with these technologies to attach immersive and multisensory experiences for their customers.\n\nA Metaverse offers this potential amalgamation of online commerce and immersive experiences and changes the way we work, interact, and play, in an online environment. Those with a keen sense of imagination have harnessed the power of the Metaverse to create a wide variety of interesting projects.\n\nAmong these companies is \ufeffTrace Network Labs\ufeff, which started its journey in 2021 with an eye into the future of online shopping and is poised to make an impact in the future. The company aims to bring new fashion and lifestyle experiences \u2013 powered and natively built using blockchains \u2013 that will empower businesses and users to expand the possibilities for digital interaction, trading, commerce and collaboration.\n\nThe inception\n\nLokesh Rao and Sunil Arora founded Trace Network Labs in 2021 to help individuals create real-life experiences for their avatars in the Metaverse. While Lokesh has assisted fashion companies in 20 countries in the acquisition and implementation of technology, Sunil has worked in the fashion industry for over 37 years. Over 1,000 apparel and fashion companies have worked with him in over 50 countries, and he has mastered the digital fashion sector in depth. He also lectures at NIFT-India, IIT-India, FIT-New York, London & Paris Schools of Fashion, as well as automation for garment manufacturing.\n\n\u201cEnvironment drives people\u2019s behaviour and Metaverse can teleport them in that environment of their choice, where they can engage in shopping, socialising and other activities like attending events, parties and fashion shows. With Pariz metaverse, we are building one single destination for GenZ to live their lifestyle, from where they can claim products in the real world too,\u201d said Lokesh Rao, Co-founder and CEO, Trace Network Labs.\n\nThe Trace Network brings fashion & lifestyle metaverse-Pariz, for next-generation that bridges the real and virtual worlds. The company is dedicated to bringing innovation and lifestyles to the Metaverse. Using Web3 with 3D + VR technology, Trace Network aims to advance meta commerce and revolutionise online shopping for all online, offline brands including D2C brands to build their metaverse retail presence with Metastores.\n\nInnovation in the Metaverse for ecommerce platforms\n\nTrace Network is at the forefront of ecommerce platform innovation in the Metaverse. This platform provides a number of innovative features and services designed to help businesses succeed in the fast-paced world of ecommerce.\n\nMeta-Commerce\n\nTrace Network Labs has already filed patents for a new innovation in the segment whereby enabling users a whole new shopping experience in its Metaverse -PARIZ. The company aims to provide consumers with a unique and immersive shopping experience that combines the best of the physical and digital worlds. In this new form of commerce, also known as experiential commerce, customers will have the opportunity to interact with products and brands in a virtual environment, thereby enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nIn addition to offering a better customer experience, better visibility into processes, increased efficiency, and more effective decision making, Trace Network Labs PARIZ Metaverse is built around these ethos:\n\n1. Adoption-centric approach to metaverse\n\nWith the rise of meta commerce and the growing popularity of virtual and augmented reality, the company aims to provide a platform for businesses and individuals likewise, to create and launch 3D experiences in the metaverse with all components powered and built natively using blockchain. This, they believe, will make real life-like experiences both accessible and user-friendly to the general public and in turn increase the adoption of metaverse.\n\n2. MetaStores to enable Meta-commerce\n\nIn its journey towards promoting Metaverse adoption and immersive shopping experience, Trace Network is pioneering a concept of 3D retail by creating MetaStores. These are virtual retail stores in the metaverse - that act like a computer gaming space where a user just needs to enter as their digital avatar. The users' avatars thus become the consumers in the MetaStore that can interact with the brand products as well as services. This makes it game-like and enables product engagements, experiences and exploration not possible in 2D environs.\n\n3. Plug-n-play integration of Metaverse-to-Home capabilities with MetaStores\n\nTrace Network specialises in activating fashion and lifestyle in the Metaverse through its metaverse-to-home capabilities and metastores. Consumers can try on clothes and accessories in a virtual environment and have them delivered to their homes with these innovative features. With this technology, consumers will be able to shop for fashion and lifestyle products seamlessly and experience the best of both worlds at the same time. Simply put, it's a \u201cBuy in the Metaverse & Delivered at Home\u201d that will complete the online commerce\u2019s discovery-to-delivery cycle in the metaverse.\n\n4. Ecommerce for the Web 3.0 generation is Online Shopping 3.0\n\nWith its decentralised and secure platform, the company aims to provide consumers with the ability to shop online without the need for intermediaries. With Trace Network\u2019s adoption-centric approach, the company aims to make online shopping more convenient, secure, and accessible for the Web 3.0 generation.\n\n5. Empowering D2C brands to have brand presence via MetaStores\n\nMany Direct-to-Consumer brands that initially started with their own online marketplaces have recently started moving to the brick-and-mortar genre with their own physical stores. With MetaStores now a reality, these D2C brands can start building their own \u2018virtual brick-and-mortar\u2019 presence in PARIZ Metaverse, thus enhancing their brand presence for those seeking their products online.\n\nPariz Beyond MetaCommerce\n\nTrace is also building utilities beyond the above mentioned experiences and use-cases in Pariz. It is believed that users around the world will look forward to creating immersive experiences that brings together\n\n1. Events - This will be a space in Pariz, where people host and attend events hosted by brands, influencers, artists, projects and more. One can organise meetups, fashion shows, fireside chats with influencers, a full-blown TED talk, or corporate get-togethers \u2014 all on the Events space in Pariz.\n\n2. Lounge - Get immersive with your meetings using the Lounge in Pariz. This will serve as an alternative to Google meet, Zoom, or a physical meeting in a club or conference room. Just create your meeting space in Pariz, invite your friends, colleagues, partners, or members and conduct the meeting in an immersive setting with your avatars.\n\nKey milestones\n\nTrace Network Labs\u2019 first product BUDDY introduces Web 3.0 avatars with lifelike appearance, with over 2,000 have already been created by the community.

        "title": "Mask Network (MASK) and TMS Network (TMSN) Explode in Price, Stacks (STX) Holding at $1 Support",
        "description": "A general uptrend has gripped the crypto market galvanizing huge cash inflows into various cryptos. However, not all cryptos are the same. Some witnessed outsized gains, while others posted only modest price appreciations. Presently, Mask Network (MASK) and TMS Network (TMSN) are delivering double-digit growth almost every day. On the other hand, Stacks (STX), a star performer just this past week, is struggling to hold its $1 support level. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s happening with these tokens.\n\nMask Network (MASK)\n\nMask Network (MASK) is a protocol that\u2019s designed to operate as a bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. Although Mask Network (MASK) offers multiple use cases in the DeFi world today, it started with just one in 2019 \u2013 to allow users to send encrypted messages on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Over time, Mask Network (MASK) has developed the smart contracts functionality, which allows developers to create advanced DeFi dApps. Today, Mask Network (MASK) can be used to build dApps for DeFi, crypto payments, decentralized storage, decentralized e-commerce, and similar purposes.\n\nMask Network (MASK) brings a whole new level of privacy to traditional internet users, which is a radically fresh approach. Now, traditional internet users don\u2019t have to give up on Web 2.0 solutions like Twitter to enjoy decentralized solutions, enhanced privacy, and superior security. Mask Network (MASK) has managed to generate a lot of buzz in recent months. As the market took off, Mask Network (MASK) rode on it with little resistance.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN)\n\nGovernment regulators are persecuting centralized exchanges (CEXs) everywhere. Decentralized crypto exchanges are battling high fees, lack of community engagement, loss-making investors, and other issues. TMS Network (TMSN) is the solution that crypto investors have been waiting for. TMS Network (TMSN) is not just an average crypto exchange. It\u2019s also an equity exchange and a forex exchange. Traders can buy and sell cryptos, CFDs, forex, and equities on TMS Network (TMSN) without creating an account. They can use their crypto wallets to directly make transactions on TMS Network (TMSN). TMS Network\u2019s (TMSN) low fees, instantaneous transactions, and a flurry of built-in features are winning investors from everywhere.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is inching towards the finale of its stage 2 presale and has already raised $3 million in token sales. TMS Network (TMSN) will soon wrap up its ICO after raising $12 million in total. Meanwhile, the native token of TMS Network, TMSN, has shot up in price by roughly 100% between stage 1 and stage 2 presale events. It\u2019s the right time to invest in TMS Network (TMSN).\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nStacks (STX) is a layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin (BTC), which seeks to bestow DeFi features and functionalities on the latter without forcing it to undergo a hard fork. Stacks (STX) brings smart contracts and dApps support to Bitcoin (BTC). Stacks (STX) attempts to use the proven security of Bitcoin (BTC) to create blockchain infrastructure that developers can use to build dApps on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nStacks (STX) is also the first-ever token to be approved by the SEC to be sold in the US. Perhaps, this is why investors trust Stacks (STX) to survive the increasing regulatory action against crypto businesses in the US. Also, the hype around Bitcoin Ordinals is creating a lot of buzz around Stacks (STX). With over 650,000 Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs minted on Stacks (STX), the platform has already proven its utility and performance. So, it\u2019s easy to see why Stacks (STX) has climbed sharply and maintained its current pricing level.\n\nYou can find out more about TMS Network: Website, Presale, Whitepaper, Telegram, Twitter.\n\nDisclaimer: Coinspeaker is not responsible for the trustworthiness, quality, accuracy of any materials on this page.

        "title": "Metaverse Project Zuck Zuck Land Announces Giveaway Campaign In Gold",
        "description": "Zuck Zuck Land\n\nWILMINGTON, DELAWARE, March 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zuck Zuck Land, the first reward-generating Metaverse project mapped to a Gold Mine in the USA, is excited to announce a campaign that includes a giveaway of gold. The campaign aims to recruit 100 lucky participants who will receive a Zucker Mole NFT that entitles them to get \"GOLD\" from the US gold mine. This is the project's first campaign, and the Zucker Mole NFT holders will have an opportunity to obtain rewards on more than one occasion.\n\nHow To Enter The Zuck Zuck Land Giveaway Campaign?\n\n\n\nTo enter the campaign, participants should go to the campaign site and create an account. Then you need to follow Zuck Zuck Land's Twitter account and retweet one of the pinned project posts.\n\n\n\nThe Quests3 application will track and verify completed missions. The campaign will run from March 31, 2023, to April 29, 2023, and 1 account will equal 1 entry. The announcement and drawing of the winners will take place on May 1, 2023, via a Twitter post.\n\nZuck Zuck Land Types of NFTs: Mole NFTs and Land NFTs\n\nThe Zucker Mole NFT grant access to the Zucker Mole Club, where NFT holders get together, do the quests and the gold giveaway takes place. Land NFTs represent virtual ownership of the Gold Mine and come in five different rarities, offering rewards ranging from 150% to 250% rewards over four years. Combined with Zucker Mole, Land NFT gives a maximum of 50% additional reward boosts on Land NFTs.\n\nZucker Mole NFT holders are automatically entitled to join the club, which is a DAO-type community-driven club where giveaways will take place to win gold and rewards from the Gold Mine projects on more than one occasion. More information on Zuck Zuck Land NFTs can be found here.\n\n\n\nZuck Zuck Land & Its Gold Mine In The USA\n\nZuck Zuck Land is Metaverse mapped by a real Gold Mine in the US and fractionalized into virtual land plots, each represented by a unique Gold Mine Land NFT. Purchasing and owning Virtual Gold Mine Land NFTs will give access to the Metaverse through $GKT rewards, Minecraft, and DAO.\n\nStory continues\n\nOwning rare NFTs offers the benefit of special boosts, and the more NFTs one owns and plays, the more attractive Zuck Zuck Land becomes. The Virtualized Gold Mine is originally located in Central Idaho, an area that is part of a rich gold mining history. Placer gold production in the Lucile, Idaho area was a major gold producer in the late 1800s.\n\nThere are many benefits to becoming a landowner and holder of a Gold Mine Land NFT. These extend from benefits to owning unique plots of land on Minecraft that will act as a location to play games. Gold mine land NFT owners may receive rewards by staking their NFTs, and the scarcity of this land may increase its value like real estate in real life. NFT holders will have exclusive access to a webcam that is installed in the Gold Mine.\n\nZuck Zuck Land's founder commented:\n\n\n\n\u201cWe possess confidence in our ability to establish a sustainable ecosystem with Zuck Zuck Land due to our exceptional qualities. How are we able to achieve this? We have secured a royalty contract with a Gold Mine Business located in the US, and we are also collaborating with not only other gold business ventures but also web3, NFT, and payment ventures to broaden our horizons and enhance our appeal.\u201d\n\nGet ready to jump into the world of Zuck Zuck Land, the Metaverse project that combines NFTs, the real Gold Mine, and a Web 3.0 experience with DeFi and play-to-earn rewards.

        "title": "The 10 most promising tools for Web 3.0 development",
        "description": "The Web 3.0 landscape encompasses a complex array of interconnected tools, applications and frameworks, all of which can help bridge the current version of the web, which is often referred to as Web 2.0, and next-generation Web 3.0 infrastructure.\n\nIt's important to determine the goals of a project before selecting a set of tools. Web 3.0 technologies promise to solve numerous problems involving payment, decentralized supply chain applications and new business models more efficiently than classic World Wide Web technologies. Setting specific goals can help development teams create a shortlist of the right tools, libraries and apps.\n\nExperts shared the following advice on how to choose Web 3.0 tools for a development project.\n\nTake advantage of trends Several trends are driving Web 3.0 applications that show promise in solving real business and consumer problems, according to Abhishek Singhal, a managing director at Deloitte Consulting. They include the following: Metaverse apps can support events, social media, commerce, marketing and branding.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) can support and monetize the creator economy, in which individuals sell their creations and services on the web.\n\nCross-border payments can work more efficiently.\n\nProcess optimization can use smart contracts to bring efficiency to real estate, financial transactions and legal processes.\n\nFractionalization of illiquid assets can drive liquidity and help democratize investments.\n\nDecentralized verification of certificates can improve automation of the hiring process.\n\nLow-code and no-code development platforms can hide the complexity of using blockchains and cryptocurrency wallets, two fundamental technologies in Web 3.0.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can raise funds for startups and other projects. Learning how to work with DAOs will be essential for Web 3.0 developers.\n\nConsider the infrastructure Michiel Oudakker, founder and strategist at About Multi-stakeholder Strategy Development, likes to break the field into different types of infrastructure. This framework makes it easier for developers to create dApps that are not controlled by any central party, according to Oudakker. The various kinds of decentralized infrastructure include the following: storage tools, including InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin;\n\ncompute platforms, which include Ethereum and Solana;\n\nidentity tools like Serto, Veramo and Sidetree;\n\nexchange tools, such as Uniswap and Sushi that help to trade assets; and\n\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) tools, which support a variety of financial transaction models for lending, borrowing and payments. For developers, the opportunities and challenges of Web 3.0 differ in several significant ways from those of Web 2.0.\n\nStart with the application Singhal said that when developers are creating a Web 3.0 application, the tools and technology stack generally depend on what type of application is being built. He breaks the developer ecosystem into the following types of tools to consider: Layer 1 blockchains provide a base network and include Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche and Tezos.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains or sidechains extend blockchains across a wider set of use cases and include Polygon, ZK Synch and many others.\n\nDevelopment tools and environments help write and test apps and include Hardhat, Truffle, Remix and Foundry.\n\nFile storage tools include IPFS, Arweave and Filecoin.\n\nWallets include MetaMask and Binance Smart Wallet.\n\nIdentity tools help connect decentralized apps to mobile wallets and include WalletConnect, Ceramic Self.ID and Solana Wallet Adapter.\n\nClient libraries help interact with blockchains and include web3.js, ethers.js, and Web3Modal.\n\nSmart contract development tools include Solidity and OpenZeppelin.\n\nRemote Procedure Call connectivity helps create performant app networks and includes tools like Infura.\n\nBlockchain indexing tools like The Graph help find data across more extensive decentralized networks. Many of the business benefits Web 3.0 developers seek, such as tokenization and visibility, are derived from the underlying blockchain architecture.",

        "title": "Top 8 Web 3.0 trends and predictions for 2023 and beyond",
        "description": "In case you missed it, a new generation of the world wide web is coming. The current iteration, Web 2.0, tends to concentrate content on social networks owned by big technology companies such as Google and Meta. In contrast, proponents claim Web 3.0 will be decentralized, enabling content creators to profit more directly from their works, which will often be paid for in cryptocurrencies and whose ownership will be verified by public entries on a blockchain.\n\nAfter a year marked by the high-profile fraud case involving FTX cryptoexchange CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, make no mistake: Web 3.0 is evolving and growing.\n\nHere are eight Web 3.0 trends and predictions to keep an eye on:\n\n1. Tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, and using blockchain technology to track them. \"One of the big innovations of Web3 are tokens -- both fungible and non-fungible assets that are inherently unique -- and the ability to program them with smart contracts that track them,\" said Avivah Litan, vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner.\n\n2. More failures in the cryptocurrency industry. Expect at least one more major cryptocurrency platform to fail in 2023, Litan said, not due to any weakness in blockchain technology, but rather human corruption. \"Last year we saw a big Ponzi scheme -- 'pump and dump' -- but it had nothing to do with technology,\" she said. \"Hopefully, we'll get all the fraudsters and the corrupt actors to go away.\" But this won't happen until regulators establish clear new regulations that they can enforce, she added.\n\n3. Enterprise use of tokenization. \"We'll see tokenization being used for supply chain monitoring and financial use cases,\" Litan said. Case in point: Financial services company Goldman Sachs just made a $100 million bet on blockchain bonds.\n\nAs a foundational technology of Web 3.0, blockchain will drive many of its key features, such as cryptocurrency and decentralization.\n\n4. Web 3.0 adoption gets real by the end of the year. Business uses based on Web 3.0 will soon go beyond experimentation to routine implementation. Gartner predicted that by 2024, 25% of enterprises will use centralized services wrapped around decentralized Web 3.0 applications. Examples of these include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for lodging and office space and tokenized real-world assets being used as collateral for decentralized finance loans.\n\n5. Convergence of simulated and real worlds. \"Web3 technologies are enhancing the way humans interact with each other and increasing the ability to create immersive experiences,\" said Scott Likens, Innovation Hub leader at consulting firm PwC. Though they are not strictly identical, the metaverse intersects with Web 3.0 technologies, expanding the possibility of social networks where individuals create and then own their own works, as opposed to Web 2.0, where there tends to be centralized ownership of digital content.\n\n6. Ethics will be established for Web 3.0, increasing trust. The development of enforceable regulations will increase trust in new environments such as the metaverse and those created by Web 3.0, according to Likens. But trust is created by human emotions, so technical provisions by themselves -- in blockchain, for example -- won't carry the day. The idea behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency at its inception was that trust was built into the technology. There is transparency because everyone can see the transactions. But people seem to need more reassurance than that. \"As enterprises, we have to create a trusted environment where people are responsible from the beginning, so our consumers know they can use this technology in a trusted way,\" Likens said. This is especially important in the wake of the highly visible cases of crypto fraud.\n\n7. Blockchain costs are likely to come down. Beyond the built-in cost of storing information on a server, there are additional costs relating specifically to blockchain. \"Gas fees\" refer to money paid to people who verify the addition of content or the additional transactions in the distributed ledgers that exist on a public blockchain. \"About a year ago, as things were exploding, the gas fees were very costly,\" said Tom Taulli, author of How to Create a Web3 Startup: A Guide for Tomorrow's Breakout Companies. As the technology takes hold this year, costs are likely to begin to level off as more competition comes on the market, he said.\n\n8. High-profile consumer plays. Large companies from a variety of sectors are showing their \"cool factor\" by creating consumer experiences based on NFTs and cryptocurrency. Watch for splashy new creations. For example, Starbucks is reportedly finishing beta testing of its Starbucks Odyssey loyalty experience based on Web 3.0 technologies. Starbucks Odyssey members will be able to earn and buy digital collectible stamps (NFTs) that will unlock access to new, immersive coffee experiences. According to its website, Starbucks is one of the first companies to integrate NFTs with an established loyalty program, creating an accessible Web 3.0 community that will enable new ways to engage with members and employees. While it can be difficult to tell at this early stage how such a high-tech experience is justified by the purchase of a relatively low-cost commodity like coffee, it can be worthwhile to the brand to appear as an early adopter, Taulli said.",

        "title": "Web 3.0 is here and India can be a big player. But it needs a gameplan",
        "description": "The third version of the internet, known as Web 3.0, is built on blockchain technology. An intelligent, autonomous, connected, and open internet is what Web 3.0 aims to build. One significant trend that is anticipated as we approach Web 3.0 is decentralisation. It is a theory that distributes power from a small group or individual to the entire population. One of the first countries to support Web 3.0 technology was India. India now has more than 230 Web 3.0 start-ups, according to the Cryptotech industry in India 2021 research by NASSCOM and WazirX. Web 3.0\u2019s progress of internet technology increases the likelihood that technology may be weaponised, cyber threats will increase in frequency, and problems with national security may occur.\n\nWeb 3.0 is an open network where all programmes and applications are created using free and open-source code. In essence, the community has access to the development code, which is a virtual resource, and the development process is maintained open. With Web 3.0, the centralised control over data by platform firms is transferred into the hands of the users, using smart protocols on blockchain that do not require middlemen. The distinction between the real world and the digital world could become less clear. For instance, in an AI-powered Web 3.0 e-commerce scenario, suppliers would be better able to comprehend the wants of the buyers. Buyers who are interested in those products and services will be shown by them. Also, buyers will see more useful and relatable advertisements. Web 3.0 can empower creators by giving them a better opportunity to monetise. About 2 million professional content creators in India can benefit from this.\n\nWeb 3.0 is predicted to have the ability to add US$ 1.1 trillion to India\u2019s GDP by 2031 if it is widely adopted. When considered in the context of India\u2019s success in the information technology enabled services (ITES) industry, this estimate gains additional support. Numerous reasons are anticipated to fuel this expansion. Both the population and consumption of India\u2019s digital base are rising quickly. Additionally, the adoption rate of digital assets is increasing roughly twice as quickly as the Internet, as evidenced by the accounts opened on centralised cryptocurrency exchanges. For more than ten years, India has been the industry leader in software development. The Web 5.0 ecosystem now has a substantial pool of skilled workers who can or have made the move. The growing tech-driven entrepreneurial environment is already taking advantage of the opportunities presented by Web 3.0. Currently, 4.5% of the total number of available positions in India are tied to the blockchain industry. Web 3.0 is giving technology-driven industries like the gaming and fintech sectors a boost. For instance, peer-to-peer lending networks based on blockchain are becoming increasingly popular. The Web 5.0 ecosystem and capabilities are currently being developed by a number of businesses, organisations, and governments. As an illustration, the India Blockchain Accelerator Program is funding Web 2.0 and Web 5.0 blockchain start-ups in Telangana.\n\nAlso read: Lucknow to Ludhiana, small-town women are entering crypto world, leaving behind tech bros\n\nWeb 3.0 is not a single technology but an amalgamation of several emerging technologies. A specialised institutional mechanism (similar to the National Supercomputing Mission) can be developed to promote Web 3.0\u2019s development and enable national-level coordination. Web 3.0\u2019s expansion depends on the expansion and availability of its foundational services. as dependable electricity, internet access, the availability of devices, etc. This platform can be built with additional work through flagship programmes like the Saubhagya Mission, BharatNet Mission, and the Electronics Development Fund. The rapid technological progress justifies the development of a policy environment that is both efficient and, at the same time, adaptable to the evolving technological landscape. This can be accomplished by copying the RBI\u2019s Regulatory Sandbox approach to the creation of FinTech products. The primary agents of development of Web 3.0 will be entrepreneurs and users. The formation of clusters, contests, incubators, and supportive policies are just a few ways to foster innovation. India could start discussions on a global scale and take part in creating the rules and guidelines for Web 3.0. Taking a proactive stance in Web 3.0 leadership would prevent India from falling victim to digital colonialism. Web 3.0\u2019s design supports the development of specialised solutions. For instance, an automatic low-data option can be provided in locations with poor internet connectivity. Web 3.0 isn\u2019t challenging, but it is unique. To guarantee quicker acceptance and a smooth transition for users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 platforms, educational programmes would be necessary.\n\nThe internet will become more democratic thanks to Web 3.0. Web 3.0\u2019s technological support means that this promise is not entirely unjustified. But in order to bring about such a revolution, cooperation, openness, reliance, trust, and\u2014most importantly\u2014a shared endeavour that eventually unites humanity are all necessary. It remains to be seen whether the vision of Web 3.0 can make all of this a reality.\n\nThe author is a student at Miranda House, University of Delhi. Views are personal",

        "title": "What is Web 3.0 and what are its characteristics?",
        "description": "Web 3.0, or Web3, is already underway and is several steps ahead of its predecessor, Web 2.0, in terms of the possibilities that companies and organisations can offer: better services and applications through the Internet. Although Web 3.0 is still in the process of development and implementation, it can be said that this third generation is characterised by being intelligent, that is, by making use of data.\n\nWhat is the purpose of using data in Web 3.0? The ability to customise the experience of services and applications and adapt them to the needs of each user. In the age of data, web environments are working to adapt to this new reality. This development is an improvement for users as it takes advantage of the increasing importance of data today. The result is a more optimised handling of information and a more efficient user experience.\n\nHow does Web 3.0 work?\n\nThis third generation allows web applications to connect with each other to personalise each person\u2019s browsing experience. The development of technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain is driving this evolution of the web, and is really shaping what it is. Through the use and application of data storage and analysis, and especially machine learning, a unique profile of each user can be created to improve the browsing experience.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blockchain seeks to encourage the decentralisation of the network in order to change the relationship that users establish with large companies and institutions, and even relationships with other users, to place the trust of relationships in blockchain technology and the security it offers. In other words, technology will bring reliability so that users and content creators themselves will be in better control of their own contributions and browsing preferences, rather than leaving it in the hands of large technology companies.\n\nIn other words, Web3 is more autonomous and reliable, as the data will no longer depend on these large companies or institutions, but on each individual.\n\nBenefits of the third generation web\n\nAlongside greater personalisation, another of the great advantages promised by Web3 is the democratisation of the network of networks, which is also called the \u201csemantic web\u201d, because it uses data analysis and AI machine learning, with the so-called \u201cData Web\u201d. What does this achieve? Searches are not sorted by keywords alone, and users and content creators have control of their data thanks to the decentralisation that blockchain brings.\n\nAs mentioned above, control of data is no longer in the hands of large corporations, it is in the hands of the users. This decentralisation eliminates major dangers such as censorship or tampering with such information, and relations between people can be direct, without the need for intermediaries.\n\nAnd although it may seem the opposite, this feature will help companies to better understand the needs of users, to offer better services, more suited to the needs of each person and even encourage the development of new products.\n\nEvolution is 3.0\n\nWeb 3.0 is not as new as it may seem. It was in 2006 when this concept first emerged thanks to designer and author Jeffrey Zeldman, and he did so as a critique of Web 2.0. It should be noted that the first website appeared in 1990 (and can still be visited at http://info.cern.ch/). At that time, the world took a first step towards global change, and although a new era was beginning, these early websites were very primitive and static. Web 1.0 offered one-way communication, where the user could only access a basic web design via the internet and receive information, with minimal interaction.\n\nWith time came Web 2.0 or the collaborative web. The new century saw an improvement in the concept of the Web: the user was gaining prominence and people were connecting to other people and to brands. This new generation promoted collaboration, content creation and information sharing. The development of social networks, the creation of blogs, video blogs, podcasts, instant messaging platforms or all online content of a cultural, educational and health nature.\n\nThis has facilitated the growth of online commerce and digital services such as telecare, telemedicine and virtual education.\n\nTechnology now opens the door to making the net neutral, eliminating censorship and manipulation of information, and is capable of guaranteeing freedom of expression and privacy. Access to any website and to transparent information should be a right for everyone.",

        "title": "Ten Web 3.0 Core Technologies to Redefine Third Generation",
        "description": "Ten Web 3.0 core technologies like Artificial intelligence and Crypto are redefining 3rd generation\n\nWeb 3.0 is built on Artificial Intelligence, the semantic web, and omnipresent characteristics. The purpose of using Artificial Intelligence is to provide end-users with quicker, more relevant data. A website that employs AI should be able to sort through and provide the information that it believes a certain user would find useful. Because the results include websites that have been voted on by people, social bookmarking as a search engine can produce better results than Google. Humans, on the other hand, can control these outcomes. This article features the ten Web 3.0 core technologies to redefine third generation.\n\nBlockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nSemantic Web\n\nThe term \u201cSemantic Web\u201d refers to W3C\u2019s vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data is empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning technologies and other major fields of artificial intelligence have exploded in popularity in recent years. These technologies are crammed inside our cellphones, which is how applications like Apple\u2019s Siri function. You can talk to an intelligent agent and have them parse what you\u2019re asking for thanks to Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\nThe Metaverse\n\nThe metaverse is a vision of what many in the computer industry believe is the next iteration of the internet: a single, shared, immersive, persistent, 3D virtual space where humans experience life in ways they could not in the physical world.\n\n3D Graphics\n\n3D computer graphics, sometimes called CGI, 3D-CGI or three-dimensional computer graphics are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering digital images, usually 2D images but sometimes 3D images.\n\nDecentralised Autonomous Organisations\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure that has no central governing body and whose members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the entity.\n\nDistributed Computing (Edge Computing)\n\nDistributed computing is the method of making multiple computers work together to solve a common problem. It makes a computer network appear as a powerful single computer that provides large-scale resources to deal with complex challenges.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary\u2019s involvement or time loss.\n\nDecentralized Apps\n\nDecentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer. DApps (also called \u201cdapps\u201d) are thus outside the purview and control of a single authority.",

        "title": "How Does Web 3.0 Evolve and Function?",
        "description": "Web 3.0, sometimes known as Web 3, is the emerging phase of the Internet. It is based on the idea of creating a totally decentralized ecosystem. This new technological dimension believes in leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and the latest technologies like Blockchain to solve the problems of the present-day internet/online ecosystem.\n\nWeb 3.0 does not require \u201cpermission\u201d. It means that central authorities don\u2019t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for \u201ctrust,\u201d referring to the idea that a mediator does not need to facilitate digital transactions between two or more parties.\n\nAlso, it protects user privacy better as well, because it\u2019s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection. Web 3.0 is an umbrella term that encompasses several ideas and ultramodern visions of decentralization where community-powered, advertising-free, and self-monetized content will reign supreme. Although it will disrupt many existing Web 2.0-based business models, the creator economy is positioned as the biggest benefactor of this ongoing revolution vis-\u00e0-vis a reinvented social media paradigm.\n\nThe future of Web3.0\n\nWith the potential to revolutionise how we use the internet, Web 3.0 will enable services to be used anywhere, thanks to the fact that all data and information are given access to multiple smart apps. With this latest technology, professionals and recent graduates from every sector will witness an internet system that is more dynamic and interactive than the one we currently use.\n\nAnd since the data is stored across several systems, there is also minimal risk of information leaks, making Web 3.0 more resilient. For example, in the healthcare industry, Web 3.0 will make automating all the incoming data a quicker, more efficient, and seamless process. Medical practitioners will then be able to rely on Web 3.0-based applications that will fasten the process of new admissions and cut down latencies in the doctor-patient relationships. For technology-related professionals, Web 3.0 will be a game-changer.\n\nWeb 3.0 in our day-to-day life\n\nThe basic idea behind the concept of Web 3 is to make the internet a smarter place. This new era of the web will make the global internet more responsive, intelligent, and capable of giving a more satisfying and tailored experience to the user. It will efficiently transform the way we know or use the internet today.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: One of the primary features of Web 3.0 will be its ability to decipher human emotions and thoughts. Artificial intelligence (AI) will be used extensively to filter data and content and to tailor the search results according to the user\u2019s preference. Semantic Web: Semantics is the study of the linkages between words. The semantic web would enable the computer to analyze data and information and then it helps to decode the meaning and emotions that they are trying to convey. This will help in giving a better and more immersive internet usage experience to the users. Ubiquity: Ubiquity means the power to be present everywhere at the same time, or in simpler words, ubiquity means omnipresence. As we know, Web 2.0, or the internet as we know it today is already quite omnipresent. Hence, Web 3.0 will simply take it a step further by making the internet more widely accessible using the Internet of Things (IoT). 3D Graphics: Web 3 or Web 3.0 will bring in new graphics technology, making the three-dimensional virtual world a reality. The use of 3D graphics will make the internet user experience more enticing and will also be helpful in transforming a variety of sectors like health, e-commerce, real estate, defense, technology, etc.\n\nChallenges and future of Web 3.0\n\nWeb 3.0 promises verifiable, self-governing, trustless, permission-less and robust transfer of data and information across the platforms. For the transition of Web from Web2 to Web3, a greater number of people should start developing and using decentralized applications.\n\nThe main challenge using these decentralized applications is that there is a large chunk of the non-technical user base existing in society. In order to make web3 a success we have to create simple decentralized applications, which are easy to use for each and every user out there. With the advancement of technology, it won\u2019t be a surprise if in the next several years, the internet shifts from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\n\nConclusion\n\nWeb 3.0 is a game-changer for businesses and entrepreneurs, and is enabling businesses to better understand their customers, and manage their data. Also, improving their products and services. For entrepreneurs, Web 3.0 benefit is making it easier to raise funds, acquire customers, and research their markets. With the right approach, businesses and entrepreneurs are capitalizing on this new technology and staying ahead of the competition. Web 3.0 is an opportunity for businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs for taking their businesses to the next level. All they require is the correct approach.",

        "description": "So Web3, for me, is not cryptocurrency, it\u2019s not blockchain, it\u2019s not tokenomics. Web3, for me, is decentralization, it\u2019s openness, it\u2019s transparency\n\nThis is how the founder of Parity Technologies, Gavin Wood, describes Web3 or Web 3.0, who coined this term in 2014. This third generation of Web technologies was initially dubbed the Semantic Web by the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. Its goal is to create a more open and independent internet \u2013 with a tinge of extra sophistication.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Web 3.0 will put an end to centralized platforms and data monopolies. Decentralization will be the main focus. Users will have full control over their data, i.e., they can choose what information to share with what party for income purposes.\n\nHow Web3 Is Different from Web2\n\nIn Web2, centralized authorities control and run the platform, cloud, and application deliveries. In Web3, Edge framework, peer-to-peer communication, and distributed procedures are becoming more and more common. In Web2, fiat or government-issued currencies, such as INR, are used for transactions. In Web3, cryptocurrencies, or digital currencies that are encrypted, like Tether, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, can be used to fund transactions.\n\nIn Web2, cookies are used to track users and help with personalization. In Web3, users can obtain non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or unique digital identifiers, having a value or certain benefits attached. Layout tools that offer more dynamic control than Web1 are what define Web2. Whereas, autonomously smarter technology, such as AI and machine learning, defines Web3.\n\nIn Web2, databases support apps and content. In Web3, blockchain immutability is used. Web2 made social networking possible through platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Web3 will help develop the Meta worlds to merge augmented, virtual, and physical reality.\n\nWeb3 \u2013 Salient Features\n\nDecentralization:\n\nIn Web3, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are a new type of regulating framework for web organizations and services. DAOs, like blockchain, rely on distributed consensus rather than a centralized authority to make decisions. Decentralized financial services, which avoid conventional banking institutions, will likely keep growing owing to Web 3.0, thus leaving a significant impact on the global financial system.\n\nDecentralization will also enable distributed applications across the Web 3.0 environment by fostering the growth of decentralized apps that utilize blockchain and smart contracts.\n\nDecentralization, automation, and intelligence will probably continue to be the cornerstones of what comes after Web 3.0 as it develops ahead.\n\nBlockchain:\n\nBlockchain technology encrypts and protects user data. This stops big tech businesses from having access to and/or using consumers\u2019 personal data to their advantage.\n\nAI:\n\nIn order to provide quicker and more accurate results, computers can interpret information, almost as ably as humans, by merging semantic skills with human language processing. By doing this, they develop greater intelligence and enhance consumer satisfaction.\n\nUniversality:\n\nIn addition to PCs and smartphones, any number of devices can be used to access internet content and services from any location at whatever time. In many respects, Web 2.0 is already commonplace, but the expansion of IoT devices will raise its profile to new heights.\n\nDistributed IT architecture\n\nInstead of processing data in a centralized store, Edge computing collects, stores, and analyzes data close to the client, where it is generated. And this forms the core of Web 3.0, which handles apps and data on intelligent devices like smartphones, smart computers, and even smart vehicles.\n\nThe 3D touch:\n\nBecause it blurs the line between the real and abstract worlds, Web 3.0\u2019s 3D graphics capability adds a new immersive dimension to the virtual horizon. Its uses can be observed in a variety of fields, including e-commerce, computer games, health, real estate, museum guides, etc.\n\nChanges Web3 Will Bring in the Upcoming Decade\n\nAccording to a report by Maximize Market Research forecastover 2022\u20132029, the overall revenue generated by Web 3.0 is anticipated to increase at 35.4% nearing USD 35.12 billion. What\u2019s intriguing about Web 3.0 is that it might address the most prevalent problems of the current Internet Era, such as data ownership and privacy, by removing middlemen and enabling individuals and businesses to engage with their audiences directly and keep the lion\u2019s share of the profit.\n\nDecentralizing data storage and use and giving people more authority by letting them solely own their data are the guiding principles of Web 3.0. The users will also be relieved from intrusive and impossible-to-skip adverts and pop-up windows.\n\nPitfalls of Web3\n\nWeb 3.0 will be challenging for less technologically proficient devices to handle because some Web 1.0 websites already feel dated. It might be very difficult for beginners to comprehend. Furthermore, as users have complete control over when and what they wish to submit, scalability concerns may arise in addition to issues like sluggish performance.\n\nDespite the murky side of Web 3.0 that has just been explored, it is still incredibly exciting and offers much bigger possibilities that will affect all facets of digital transformation. It will be up to you to decide what your goals are. To make sure you have a free-flowing Web 3.0 presence that satisfies the requirements of your business, you\u2019d better have it clear from your IT security, BI, compliance officers, and communication designers.\n\nThe article has been written by Abhishek Agarwal, President Judge India & Global Delivery at The Judge Group",

        "description": "Web 3.0 is considered the third version of the internet.\n\nIf the number of investments and the accompanying buzz are considered, Web3 or Web 3.0 is clearly the future of the internet.\n\nAccording to Emergen Research, the global Web 3.0 market size reached $3.2 Billion in 2021 and is expected to register a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 43.7% to reach a whopping $81.5 Billion by 2030.\n\nWeb 3.0 is considered the third version of the internet. A 2020 Twitter post described the three iterations of the Web in these words:\n\nWeb 1: Read\n\nWeb 2: Read-Write\n\nWeb 3: Read-Write-Own \u2014 him.eth (@himgajria) May 29, 2020\n\nWeb 1.0 was 'read-only', with a static website having almost zero user interaction. Present-day Web 2.0 is a 'read-write', epitomised by the rise of social media and user-generated content. Web 3.0 will be 'read-write-own', as it will help secure data.\n\nRaj A Kapoor, founder and CEO of India Blockchain Alliance, elaborates how data is secured on Web 3.0: \"When we use a platform like Facebook, our data is collected, owned, and monetised by them. In Web 3.0, our data is stored on a crypto wallet. We engage with apps and communities on Web 3.0 through our wallet. We can also take our data with us when we log off.\"\n\nData security on Web 3.0 will be possible due to blockchain technology. Blockchain will help keep information on Web 3.0 organised in the form of blocks. These blocks are immutable and validated by a consensus through asymmetric cryptography like keys or digital signatures. Thus, users can access resources, applications, agreements, and content with greater security.\n\nMr Kapoor adds that Web 3.0 will enable data privacy as a crypto wallet isn't easily linked to someone's real identity. \"While someone might be able to see the activity of someone's wallet, they won't know that it's your wallet.\"\n\nWhile Web 3.0 is expected to streamline ever-growing crypto transactions, newer use cases are likely to emerge out of it.\n\nWeb3 can help people buy assets like virtual real estate through partial ownership, eliminate intermediaries in transactions in media and entertainment, and decentralise businesses by enabling community ownership of companies like Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, notes a Chainalysis report.\n\nIf Web 2.0 is currently about the virtual world, Web 3.0 is about bridging the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. The 'bridges' between the two worlds are several 21st-century technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality (all three are the cornerstone for metaverse), etc., that Web 3.0 can host.\n\n\"Brands across sectors are adopting Web 3.0 to offer personalised, superior customer experience in the immersive world. Gamification and marketing are the two prominent Web 3.0 use cases which cut across domains,\" adds Sharat Chandra, Vice President, Research and Strategy, EarthID.\n\nIf the recent Chainalysis report is to be believed, blockchain-powered metaverse, VR and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) will rule Web 3.0. In particular, as noted by the report, gaming is likely to grow exponentially in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.\n\nPowered by blockchain, Web 3.0 gaming is also called play-to-earn or play-to-own gaming. In Web3 gaming, NFT assets are owned by the players. They can be sold, too \u2013 something impossible in Web 2.0 Chainalysis, quoting a DappRadar report, says that blockchain-based gaming activity has increased 2,000% since 2021.\n\nIn another significant development, which will change how people play games and operate on Web 3.0, several Web 3.0 firms have teamed up to create the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3 or OMA3. This alliance aims for a \"metaverse without restraining walls, where individual platforms are interconnected and fully interoperable.\"\n\nThe launch of OMA3 \u2013 a DAO with 'inclusive, transparent, and decentralised governance' \u2013 also signals Web 3.0 role in converging different elements of metaverse and blockchain technology.\n\nWhile Web 3.0 is positioning itself as the future of the internet, there are a few red flags too. Primary among them is 'decentralisation' \u2013 the main premise of Web3 itself.\n\n\"True decentralisation remains elusive as all leading blockchain protocols are controlled by a few select wallets,\" says Mr Chandra.\n\nDecentralised Finance (DeFi), a by-product of blockchain technology, is a cause of concern too. The Chainalysis report states that DeFi protocols became the go-to target for hackers looking to steal crypto in 2021.\n\nMoney laundering via DeFi is another issue. \"So far in 2022, DeFi protocols have become the biggest recipient of illicit funds, taking in 69% of all funds sent from addresses associated with criminal activity,\" the report says.",
