        "description": "On the night of March 21, North Indian cities saw more than usual people in societies and colonies hurrying down the stairs and leaving their homes. This was because of what many described intense and sustained tremors they felt.\n\nTurns out, there was an earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale that originated in Afghanistan. Tremors were felt in several Pakistani and Indian cities. In India, people in Jaipur, Amritsar, Delhi, Noida, Srinagar, etc, mostly in northwestern parts, reported intense tremors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after, we saw that the fans were also shaking. The earthquake was strong in terms of intensity and stayed for a longer period. - Noida resident (PTI)\n\nWhat do we know about the earthquake?\n\nThe US Geological Survey reported that a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck 40 km southeast of Jurm in Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan.\n\nThe earthquake was deep; about 187.6 km below the earth's surface, one of the reasons why the tremors were felt over a long distance in parts of Tajikistan, Pakistan, and India.\n\nShallow earthquakes, like the one recently in Turkey and Syria (just 10 km deep), are devastating, as the energy they release emerges more intensely on the surface.\n\n(just 10 km deep), are devastating, as the energy they release emerges more intensely on the surface. However, with deeper earthquakes, the quakes spread farther, and the seismic waves lose energy as they come to the surface. This is why no great damage was reported in India.\n\nThe earthquake originated in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which is prone to earthquakes.\n\nCasualties:\n\nIn India, no in injuries, loss of life, or damage to property were reported. There was only a false alarm of building damage in Delhi.\n\nIn Pakistan, at least three people have died and some 41 have been injured in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Landslides were also reported in Abbottabad.\n\nLandslides were reported in Tajikistan in areas nearing Afghanistan.\n\nAt least two people have died in Afghanistan. However, there are fears of more casualties as a clearer picture emerges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there could be more casualties as the quake was so powerful, in most parts of the country. - Sharafat Zaman Amar, Taliban spokesperson\n\nThe Associated Press said that at least 11 people have died in Afghanistan and Pakistan combined.\n\nThe last horrifying earthquake in Afghanistan occurred in June 2022. A 6.1 magnitude earthquake in southeastern Afghanistan killed over 1,000 people. Similar earthquakes in Afghanistan have killed thousands of people over the years.\n\n#Earthquake | Follow these do's and don'ts to ensure your safety before, during and after an #Earthquake. pic.twitter.com/j1favudlum \u2014 NDMA India | \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0906\u092a\u0926\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0902\u0927\u0928 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0915\u0930\u0923 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@ndmaindia) March 21, 2023\n\nThe Great Himalayan Earthquake:\n\nFor a long time, scientists have said that a Great Himalayan Earthquake is long overdue; and by long we mean centuries. It is also inevitable.\n\nAnd several major Indian cities like Delhi and Gurugram sit precariously over fault lines, even though no major earthquake has struck the areas in modern history.\n\nYou see, the western Himalayas continues to be one of the most dangerous and active seismic zones in the world.\n\nThe inevitable great earthquake can strike anywhere between the Hindu Kush mountain range in Afghanistan and the end of Arunachal Pradesh in India.\n\nThis is because the Indo-Australian tectonic plate is in collision with the Eurasian plate, which is also the reason for the creation of the Himalayas.\n\nPhoto: World Atlas\n\nIn the past 500 years, there has not been an earthquake over magnitude 8; even though lesser magnitude earthquakes have caused much damage, like the 2015 Nepal quake and the 2005 Jammu and Kashmir quake, mostly affecting Pakistan-administered areas.\n\nThis means that there is a great amount of pent-up energy caused by the friction between the two tectonic plates, which can only be released in the form of a massive earthquake.\n\nThe central Himalayan region is even more prone to earthquakes because of a seismic gap, which is an absence of a massive earthquake.\n\nUsually, strong earthquakes have a seismic cycle. If a magnitude 7 earthquake strikes one region, it takes a decade for the same magnitude earthquake to strike again.\n\nSo, this Himalayan region is overdue for a magnitude 8 earthquake.",

        "title": "Why parts of North India felt big tremors of a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Afghanistan",
        "description": "Tremors lasting several seconds were felt in Delhi and other parts of North India as a strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Tuesday night, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.\n\nThe earthquake was deep, with its origin 187.6 km below the earth\u2019s surface, the USGS said. Deep earthquakes tend to be felt over large distances, which is why tremors were experienced in Punjab, Rajasthan\u2019s Jaipur, and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe epicentre of the earthquake was near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan, about 300 km north of Kabul, quite close to Afghanistan\u2019s borders with Tajikistan, according to the USGS. This is an earthquake-prone region where six-plus earthquakes are not rare. A similar 6.1 magnitude earthquake had occurred very close to this place in 2018 as well, which again was felt through most of northern India.\n\nA 6.1 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed over 1,000 people last year.\n\nHow big is the earthquake?\n\nHow much damage an earthquake will cause depends on its depth and magnitude.\n\nShallow earthquakes are generally more devastating because they carry greater energy when they emerge on the surface. Deeper earthquakes lose much of their energy by the time they come to the surface. The deeper quakes spread farther \u2014 the seismic waves move radially upwards to the surface \u2014 even as they lose energy while travelling greater distances, and hence cause less damage. Thus, the current tremors are unlikely to cause much damage in India.\n\nThis earthquake was of 6.5-magnitude. The earthquake magnitude scale gives a measure of the energy released, although the reading in itself is not of energy. Rather, it takes into account amplitude or \u2018size\u2019 of the seismic waves released, and variations in distance between various seismographs and the earthquake epicentre. Thus, it is a dimensionless number \u2014 with no physical units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it used to be measured on the Richter ccale, nowadays, the \u2018moment magnitude scale\u2019 is used as it is more accurate for bigger quakes. Both scales are logarithmic \u2013 which means the seismic waves produced by a magnitude 6 earthquake have 10 times higher amplitude than the ones produced by a magnitude 5 earthquake. The energy differential is even higher, 32 times (31.623 or 10 raised to the power 1.5 to be precise), for every change of 1 in magnitude.\n\nWestern Himalayas risky zone\n\nWestern Himalayas continues to be the one of the most dangerous seismic zones in the world. Scientists say the Himalayan region, the 2500-km stretch from the Hindu Kush mountains to the end of Arunachal Pradesh, is due for a big earthquake, of a magnitude over 8 on Richter scale, anytime. This is because of the huge amount of energy stored along the faultlines due to the continuous interaction of different techtonic plates. The energy can be released only in the form of massive earthquakes.\n\nEarthquakes remain unpredictable\n\nEarthquakes continue to remain the most common natural hazard that cannot be predicted. As such, no early warning systems can be developed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheoretically, it is possible to offer a lead time of a few seconds between the time of the origin of the earthquake and the time it reaches the Earth\u2019s surface. Seismic waves travel significantly slower than the speed of light \u2014 between 5 and 13 km per second. So if the earthquake is detected as soon as it is triggered, information about it can be related a few seconds ahead of it reaching the ground.\n\nSuch systems are already in use in some locations to issue alerts about earthquakes. However, these are not predictions. The alerts are issued post-event.\n\nAttempts to find reliable predictors to earthquakes have not been fruitful so far. Scientists have been able to map the areas that are earthquake prone, and are likely to generate earthquakes in future, but there is no way to predict when.",

        "description": "A mild intensity earthquake of magnitude 2.8, with its epicentre in Himachal Pradesh's Kinnaur, hit the state at 12:51 am on Wednesday soon after strong tremors shook north India on Tuesday night. However, no damage was reported, officials said.\n\nEarlier, tremors were felt in almost all parts of the state around 10:17 on Tuesday night following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake whose epicentre was in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush area at a depth of 156 km. People in Shimla, Mandi and several other places ran out of their houses in panic but no loss of life or property has been reported so far, the officials said.\n\nTremors were felt in all the 12 districts of the state but no loss of life or damage to property has been reported, Special Secretary Disaster Management Sudesh Mokta had told The PTI. In the past 24 hours, more than 10 earthquakes were witnessed in India and the nearby region. Their magnitude was between three and four, he added.\n\nAt least 11 people were killed, while more than 100 people were injured after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake jolted Pakistan and Afghanistan on Tuesday, the news agency Associated Press reported. The epicentre was in Afghanistan and the affected countries included Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China, and Kyrgyzstan, reports said.\n\nStrong tremors from the earthquake were also felt in Delhi-NCR and across much of northern India last night.\n\n\"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter Scale hit 133km SSE of Fayzabad, Afghanistan today at 10:17 pm IST,\" said National Centre for Seismology. The US Geological Survey said the centre of the magnitude 6.5 quake was 40km (25 miles) south-south-east of Jurm in Afghanistan\u2019s mountainous Hindukush region, bordering Pakistan and Tajikistan.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s disaster mitigation ministry told Reuters that at least two people were killed in Laghman province. In neighboring Pakistan, at least nine people died, including a 13-year-old girl who died when a wall collapsed at her home, and at least 100 others were injured.\n\nAfghanistan is habitually hit by tremors, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which lies close to the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian structural plates.\n\nA Noida resident said he first noticed the dining table shaking. \"Soon after we saw that the fans were also shaking. The earthquake was strong in terms of intensity and stayed for a longer period,\" the resident of Hyde Park society in Noida was quoted saying by the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Fire Director Atul Garg said, \"No building in Shakarpur area was found tilted. An initial call was given by some of the neighbours. The occupants of the building were not aware of the call.\"\n\nMahesh Palawat, Vice president Meteorology And climate tweeted, \u201cIt was a strong #earthquake. Worse is over now. Aftershocks are usually milder. Of moderate intensity. Can damage old buildings in the vicinity which are damaged by main event. May not be felt in #India. no worries. #AfghanistanEarthquake #earthquake\"\n\nEarthquake zones of India\n\nIndia is divided into four seismic zones based on the intensity of earthquakes that are likely to occur in these areas.\n\nZone V is the most severe intensity zone, which includes parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir valley), the western part of Himachal Pradesh, the eastern part of Uttarakhand, Kutch in Gujarat, part of northern Bihar, all northeastern states of India, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.\n\nZone IV is the severe intensity zone and includes Ladakh, remaining parts of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, some parts of Haryana, parts of Punjab, Delhi, Sikkim, the northern part of Uttar Pradesh, small portions of Bihar and West Bengal, parts of Gujarat and small portions of Maharashtra near the west coast, and a small part of western Rajasthan.\n\nZone III is the moderate intensity zone, which includes Kerala, Goa, Lakshadweep islands, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, remaining parts of Gujarat and Punjab, parts of West Bengal, western Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, remaining part of Bihar, northern parts of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, and parts of Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\n\nZone II is the low intensity zone, which includes remaining parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.",

        "title": "Activation of the Disaster Portal for the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye/Syria - Syrian Arab Republic",
        "description": "During catastrophic events such as the recent T\u00fcrkiye/Syria earthquake, the road infrastructure in the affected area is often widely interrupted and accessibility varies over time. In spite of this, it is imperative to quickly provide assistance to the affected people. Humanitarian Organizations need real-time information for force and logistics planning: Which roads are still passable? How can I reach my destination given the current situation? How is access to healthcare facilities affected? Which border crossings are passable from T\u00fcrkiye to Syria?\n\nIn the wake of the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria in February 2023, HeiGIT set up an instance of the disaster portal for the impacted region with input from the MSF GIS Middle East Team (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res/Doctors Without Borders), who are supporting the operation of MSF in Syria and have a need for coordinating supply efforts on the ground.\n\nHeiGIT's disaster portal is a service that aims towards helping during disaster relief efforts by providing up-to-date information for planning routes and generating areas of reachability while taking inaccessible parts of the road network into consideration. The portal includes feature storage for disaster areas like blocked roads, bridges destroyed by earthquakes, or borders blocked due to conflict. These features are automatically avoided when generating routes or isochrones.\n\nFor the activation in the Anatolia region, HeiGIT retrieved publicly available data from the World Food Program (WFP) Logistics Cluster on the status of roads and border control points and integrated it as avoid areas and overlay. The closed border points can therefore be avoided by routing. The MSF GIS Middle East Team shared their experiences in disaster situations, tried out the service and provided their valuable feedback and input, contributing to a first path to an open source service meeting the needs of humanitarian actors efforts.\n\nThe web application is based on the existing web client showcasing the features of the Openrouteservice API, but has some additional features that help specifically in disaster scenarios. The underlying OpenStreetMap data, which is utilized to build the road network graphs, is updated every 10 minutes. Therefore, the latest OSM data can be utilized in the service.\n\nThe Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) organizes projects for rapid and collaborative mapping in urgent disaster situations. In the Anatolia Earthquake, 13 urgent mapping projects were activated with more than 15,000 volunteers contributing mainly roads and buildings. Anytime a road in OpenStreetMap is added or edited, the change will be integrated into the Disaster Portal within a couple of minutes, and thus be used to calculate routes. The routing also considers all attributes available for the roads mapped: for example, roads that are tagged in OSM with the attributes smoothness=impassable or access=no are avoided.\n\nThe proof of concept of the disaster portal found favor with potential users during catastrophic events. Xavier Charles (GIS Regional Technical Referent for Middle East at MSF) stated, \"It is an awesome tool that already fulfills the purpose of saving extra effort and time in emergency response.\" In general, the Disaster Portal tool already covers the most important aspects for possible use cases of MSF, and its functionalities, as well as integrated features, can also be used in the long term beyond the response phase.\n\nBased on this application case, we are now happy to receive feedback on further needs on features or data sets as well as other requests. We are very much looking forward to further developing the disaster portal so it can create a positive impact in response efforts for all kinds of humanitarian organizations.\n\nFor more insights, you can check out our explanatory video.\n\nIf you are interested in setting up an instance for an Area of Interest (AOI) or in receiving access to be able to add and save your individual avoid areas, feel free to contact us via info@heigit.org.",

        "description": "Plans in Place to Respond to a Major Earthquake\n\nThe Security Forces have advised that plans are in place to respond immediately should the country experience a major earthquake.\n\nRepresentatives from the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM); the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF); Jamaica Defence Force (JDF); Ministry of Health and Wellness and the Earthquake Unit, University of the West Indies gave the assurance, today (March 21), during a JIS \u2018Think Tank\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe JCF has a plan to deal with any major event, whether it be planned or unplanned. Earthquakes would be one of those emergencies for which we are prepared,\u201d said Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in charge of the Operations Branch, Michael Bailey.\n\nHe pointed out that while the Force cannot be 100 per cent ready, there is capacity to respond immediately and to ensure that all relevant agencies and services are engaged.\n\n\u201cTo respond in the initial phase, the JCF would establish a Command Post at the Police Emergency Communication Centre, gather information as to what transpired and provide that information to ODPEM,\u201d SSP Bailey informed, adding that a senior officer would be assigned to manage the Emergency Operations Centre at ODPEM.\n\nThe information collected would also be shared with the police high command and all other emergency departments. It will also be used to determine the type of response that will be deployed by the JCF.\n\n\u201cWe have the capacity to provide canine support. In the initial phase that would be search and rescue [while] in the recovery phase, to search for deceased,\u201d SSP Bailey informed.\n\nIn the event of an earthquake, the JCF would also be required to ensure that affected areas are properly cordoned and secured.\n\n\u201cWe would have to ensure that routes leading to and from our major hospitals are clear or to provide information as to the clearest and safest routes to and from those hospitals and ensure that they are maintained in a safe manner for the emergency units to respond,\u201d he added.\n\nSSP Bailey indicated that overall, the JCF\u2019s main activities during an earthquake would be to provide security, safety and to share information not just with the emergency departments but also with the public.\n\n\u201cIf we need additional manpower, we would ensure that what we call Confinement to Barracks, meaning that all police personnel would have to be on duty and remain in the area where they work,\u201d he explained.\n\nLike the JCF, the JDF also has dogs to assist in search and rescue.\n\n\u201cWe also have our air wing and airlift assets or strategic aircraft that we are able to use to hoist goods [and] equipment as required from one place to another,\u201d said Major Rodane Leung, noting that roadways are likely to be blocked or congested, preventing the movement of cargo if an earthquake occurs.\n\nThe aircraft is also equipped to move personnel as well as assist the Jamaica Fire Brigade if there is a fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Director General (Acting), ODPEM, Richard Thompson, said that from a disaster risk management perspective, Jamaica is prone to earthquakes, and as such, it is important that all the major preparedness measures are put in place.\n\n\u201cFor us on the preparedness side, we have to ensure that as a country we are prepared, and so from an infrastructural standpoint that\u2019s really how you look at the hard side of earthquake preparedness, and on the softer side of earthquake preparedness, you talk about public education and awareness,\u201d said Mr. Thompson.\n\nHe further noted that from the engineering perspective, \u201cwe have to ensure that we are hardening our infrastructure and that we are building earthquake-ready infrastructure, especially our buildings\u201d.",

        "title": "What Turkey\u2019s earthquake tells us about the science of seismic forecasting",
        "description": "The magnitude-7.8 earthquake in Turkey last month destroyed many buildings, such as this one in the city of Kahramanmara\u015f.Credit: Adem Altan/AFP via Getty\n\nTwo decades ago, John McCloskey drew a red line on a map of southeastern Turkey to pinpoint where a large earthquake would probably strike. The only question was when.\n\nThe answer came last month, when a magnitude-7.8 shock hit the precise location that McCloskey and his team had identified. It struck at 4.17 a.m. local time on 6 February, when most people were asleep, and killed more than 50,000 residents in Turkey and neighbouring Syria.\n\nOne MRI for 4.7 million people: the battle to treat Syria\u2019s quake survivors\n\nMcCloskey\u2019s work shows both the promise \u2014 and limitations \u2014 of the science of earthquake forecasting. Although geologists have long attempted to provide warnings of the location, magnitude and exact time of future quakes, decades of research have shown that it\u2019s probably impossible to predict when a geological fault will start to shake. \u201cWhen you try to winnow it down to know what\u2019s going to happen next, it tends to be a lesson in humility,\u201d says Susan Hough, a geophysicist in the Earthquake Hazards Program at the United States Geological Survey (USGS). \u201cThe real focus in most of the world is not on prediction, but on assessing the hazard and the long-term rates of earthquakes.\u201d\n\nToday, researchers work on forecasting: identifying which fault segments are most dangerous and what size earthquakes they are expected to produce. Armed with that knowledge, policymakers can take steps to reduce death and destruction by, for example, requiring better building practices or urging local residents to prepare. Some regions of Japan, the United States and Turkey have developed early-warning systems that alert residents when an earthquake has started nearby. \u201cIn principle, you can get rid of seismic risk,\u201d McCloskey says.\n\nDanger zone\n\nTurkey is a seismically active junction at which several pieces of Earth\u2019s crust meet and grind against each other. In southeast Turkey and northern Syria, the Arabian plate is pushing north against the Anatolian plate, squeezing it to the west. But the shift isn\u2019t one smooth movement. Instead, friction holds the plates in place, sometimes for centuries. When the stress overcomes the friction, the plates on either side of the fault line will shudder past each other, releasing tremendous energy in the form of an earthquake.\n\nThis has happened time and time again in Turkey \u2014 a history that allowed McCloskey and his colleagues to map the stresses along one of its major quake sources, the East Anatolian fault. Like other faults, it is divided into segments that slip at different times. When one segment shifts and shakes, it alters the stress on neighbouring sections of the same fault and other faults nearby. That increases the stress in some places, bringing them closer to failure, but relaxes stress on others \u2014 making them safer for the time being.\n\nA fracture cuts across a road in the Kahramanmara\u015f region of Turkey after two strong earthquakes on 6 February.Credit: Utku Ucrak/Anadolu Agency via Getty\n\n\u201cThey are not just randomly occurring earthquakes,\u201d says Ross Stein, chief executive of Temblor, a company specializing in seismic hazard and risk assessment. \u201cThey are in a conversation. And that conversation is carried out through stress transfer.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, McCloskey (now a geophysicist at the University of Edinburgh, UK) and his colleagues used this technique to diagnose regions on the East Anatolian fault that were highly stressed. With the help of historical records, the team incorporated the stress changes caused by ten earthquakes since 1822 into a model of ongoing plate movement. The modelling suggested that a region of the fault line south of Kahramanmara\u015f \u2014 the precise location and length of the fault that ruptured on 6 February \u2014 was at a heightened risk of giving way at some point in the future1. The team even knew that it would be devastating, forecasting a quake of magnitude 7.3 or higher. \u201cThe correspondence is remarkable,\u201d McCloskey says.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time that this method, technically known as Coulomb stress transfer, has accurately pinpointed an upcoming trembler. In 1997, Stein and his colleagues analysed the earthquakes that had already struck Turkey\u2019s North Anatolian fault to estimate that the next might occur near the city of Izmit2. Two years later, that quake arrived \u2014 killing more than 17,000 people. In 2005, McCloskey and his colleagues calculated that the shift in stress after the 2004 Sumatra\u2013Andaman quake in Indonesia might cause one in the Sunda trench west of Sumatra3. It came 12 days after the study was published. And in 2008, Shinji Toda from the Geological Survey of Japan in Tsukuba and his colleagues projected that the Wenchuan earthquake earlier that year in China would increase the stress of three adjacent faults4. In the following decade, two of those faults unleashed powerful earthquakes.\n\nAdded stress\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to use the technique everywhere. Because this model requires some knowledge of previous earthquakes, often centuries in the past, researchers can use it to assess only regions where the seismic history is well known. So it is most successful in forecasting aftershocks, which are typically smaller than main shocks. Still, there are many unknowns, and scientists are working hard to evaluate the model further.\n\nIn 2002, Tom Parsons, a geophysicist at the USGS, analysed more than 2,000 earthquakes with magnitudes of greater than 5.5 that occurred after \u2014 and near \u2014 quakes larger than magnitude 7. He found that 61% of the later quakes were associated with an increase in stress caused by the earlier ones5. The findings suggest that Coulomb stress transfer can accurately identify faults that are more likely to cause damaging quakes, he says. Then, in 2008, Parsons and his colleagues published a forecast following the Wenchuan earthquake with the intention of later evaluating the model\u2019s performance6. That work is ongoing.\n\nWhy the Tongan eruption will go down in the history of volcanology\n\nToday, Stein, one of the researchers who developed the theory about how forces shift after earthquakes7, estimates that the method has been used in 30,000 papers to explain two-thirds of our planet\u2019s recent aftershocks and progressive main shocks. \u201cThat tells us this is not the only game in town,\u201d Stein says. \u201cFaults are grungy, messy features and they don\u2019t behave as we would like them to.\u201d\n\nMcCloskey\u2019s model, for example, anticipated the location of the recent Turkey earthquake, but the shaking started on a much smaller branch of the fault and then spilt over to the main part, a pattern that Stein finds baffling. Another complication is that the main earthquake was also much larger than anticipated, probably because it re-ruptured a segment to the south that broke in 1822 and a segment to the north, which broke in 1893.\n\n\u201cThis really underlines the problem of earthquake forecasting,\u201d McCloskey says. \u201cEven when we identify the place that is most dangerous, every earthquake is unique.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, seismologists thought they might be able to predict some quakes days or hours before they strike. Such hopes emerged from Parkfield, California, where earthquakes had rocked a small part of the San Andreas fault nearly every 22 years. Each of these quakes followed a smaller shock to the north. And hours before a strong quake near Parkfield in 1966, precursory movement had broken an irrigation pipeline that crossed the fault.\n\n\u201cIn 1966, earthquake prediction looked like it was ours to have,\u201d Stein says. Before the next anticipated earthquake, geologists wired the area with hundreds of seismometers \u2014 hoping to find some harbinger that could be used to forecast future quakes. But when the next quake hit, researchers saw no warning signs.\n\nOther precursors have similarly vanished. Over the years, scientists have analysed increasing amounts of radon in local water, electromagnetic signals from Earth\u2019s crust and even odd animal behaviour. But none of these potential precursors stood up to statistical tests. \u201cDespite all kinds of startling, promising shreds of evidence, we haven\u2019t made an iota of progress toward actually predicting earthquakes,\u201d Stein says.\n\nMcCloskey doesn\u2019t think that it will ever happen. And Hough, who wrote a book called Predicting the Unpredictable (2009), argues that most geologists in the West don\u2019t even work on it \u2014 at least, not any more. \u201cWe know how unlikely it is that suddenly something is going to show up that we can see before every big earthquake,\u201d Stein says.\n\nEven though geoscientists can\u2019t predict quakes with any precision, many researchers say it is possible to prevent much of the death and destruction from these natural disasters.\n\nAfter the 1999 earthquake in Izmit, Aykut Barka, a geologist at Istanbul Technical University, warned that the increased stress could trigger a similar rupture near D\u00fczce, a town roughly 100 kilometres east8. His work persuaded the authorities to close school buildings that had been damaged by the Izmit shock. When a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck the city 2 months later, the buildings collapsed.\n\nEarly warnings\n\nEarthquake forecasting could help in other regions as well. California, for example, which is home to the massive San Andreas fault, has implemented the beginnings of an early-warning system that relies on networks of seismometers to detect the very start of a quake. That can provide seconds or minutes of advance notice to Californians to \u2018drop, cover and hold on\u2019 while automatically triggering life-saving measures such as slowing trains to a stop.\n\nHow dangerous is Africa\u2019s explosive Lake Kivu?\n\nIn 2002, Turkey implemented an early-warning system in Istanbul that will slow trains, open lift doors and shut down critical processes in factories in the case of an earthquake. The country has also implemented building codes, but many scientists were concerned that they weren\u2019t being enforced rigorously enough. Mustafa Erdik, a retired civil engineer at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University in Istanbul and president of the Turkish Earthquake Foundation, agrees that this was the case \u2014 arguing that ignorance, incompetence and implicit collusion between architects, inspectors and builders were at fault.\n\nThat makes February\u2019s aftermath particularly painful for those researchers who have been sounding the alarm for years. \u201cYou put a red line on a map, and you understand that means lots of people are going to be killed and their houses destroyed,\u201d McCloskey says.\n\n\u201cThe Turkey earthquake to me is, of course, a complete tragedy,\u201d he says. Yet McCloskey is hopeful that we will learn from it. If we do, the next red line he draws on a map will not necessarily equal a catastrophic loss of lives.",

        "description": "The hilly state Uttarakhand has been at the edge of matters, since after the huge Joshimath cracks that forced an entire town to displace to save themselves. In the latest of the attacks, three earthquake tremors were felt within 12 hours on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, said Disaster Management Secretary Ranjit Sinha.\n\nUttarakhand that is situated on the Himalayas, run the risk of facing frequent earthquakes because the Himalayas are a young-fold mountains that is still rising.\n\nThree back-to-back earthquakes in Uttarakhand\n\nThe epicenter of the earthquake has been described as the northern region of Uttarkashi. The area of Uttarkashi falls in India's seismic zone 'V Zone' (maximum risk).\n\nIn the state, the first tremor was felt at 12.45 AM in the Siror forest of Bhatwari block. The magnitude of the earthquake was 2.5 on the Ritcher Scale. The third tremor was felt at around 10.10 am. The intensity was measured at 1.8 on the Ritcher scale.\n\nWith this, 12 earthquake tremors have been felt in Uttarakhand in the last two months.\n\nUttarakhand- seismic zone 'V Zone'\n\nIn February, scientists at Hyderabad-based CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute had warned that Uttarakhand runs the risk of facing \u2018massive earthquake'. This warning was sounded including the Joshimath area.\n\n\u201cUttarakhand falls in a seismic gap where a great earthquake is waiting to occur,\" Dr Purnachandra Rao, chief scientist, Seismology, NGRI had told Deccan Herald.\n\nThe scientist further informed the news daily that the pressure built up underneath the Himalayas due to the tectonic movement will be released.

Sign up here.)\n\n1. Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is bracing for several potential scenarios related to a possible indictment from the Manhattan grand jury probing a hush money scheme. Even as there are signs the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged role in the scheme to quietly pay adult film star Stormy Daniels is nearing an end, it is not clear yet that the former president will be charged or when those charges could be unveiled. Still, Trump has created a media spectacle around how \u201cunfair\u201d an indictment would be \u2013 a move likely intended to fire up his base to generate funding for his 2024 presidential bid, analysts say. Separately, the Justice Department has also convinced a federal judge that Trump used one of his defense attorneys in furtherance of a crime related to the classified documents probe. This marks the first time that the DOJ is arguing it has evidence that Trump may have committed a crime.\n\n2. Economy\n\nAn announcement on interest rates and new economic projections are expected from the Federal Reserve later today. It will be the first time the world hears from Fed officials since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank \u2013 and as the US banking system remains under intense pressure. If the Fed follows its pattern of aggressive rate hikes over the past year, it will likely raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, underscoring its commitment to fighting inflation. However, some analysts say there is a chance policymakers may decide to hold rates steady this time around due to the ongoing banking turmoil.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Countdown to Fed's big decision on interest rates 04:39 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Covid-19\n\nWhile most Americans have put Covid-19 vaccines on the back burner, health officials in the US are now weighing whether to offer another round of bivalent boosters for people at high risk of infection, according to a source familiar with the deliberations. Officials are considering this step because the virus that causes Covid-19 has evolved and protection from existing boosters may be waning. Data recently presented to the CDC shows that in the first two months after adults get the updated booster, the shot appears to be about 50% more effective at preventing hospital or emergency room visits due to Covid-19. By four months, however, the added protection falls to a little more than 30%. Citing this trend, the United Kingdom and Canada have begun allowing certain people to get another bivalent booster.\n\n4. Earthquake\n\nA powerful 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan and Pakistan on Tuesday, killing at least 13 people after it damaged buildings and triggered landslides. Officials today said the death toll could rise much higher following the tremors that were felt in several major Pakistani cities and as far away as the Indian capital New Delhi. Dozens of others were injured in affected areas, according to health officials, and rescue teams have been dispatched to some extremely remote areas that don\u2019t have cell phone service. Just weeks ago, one of the deadliest earthquakes this century struck Turkey, close to the Syrian border, killing more than 50,000 people and sending aftershocks reverberating throughout the region.\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nA dayslong meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded today, leaving no question about Beijing\u2019s commitment to Russia amid its onslaught in Ukraine. Ultimately, the meetings yielded no breakthrough in resolving the conflict. Both leaders emphasized that peace talks should be used to solve the Ukraine crisis, but Kyiv and the West say any peace agreement must include the withdrawal of Russian troops. Meanwhile, Russia hit Ukraine overnight with another wave of attacks using Iran-made Shahed drones. A total of 21 drones were launched against Ukraine from the north shortly before midnight local time, 16 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Putin & Xi expand ties 03:41 - Source: CNN\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nSupreme Court will hear arguments in Jack Daniel\u2019s case vs. dog toy company\n\nLawyers for distiller Jack Daniel\u2019s will argue before the Supreme Court today that a dog toy company is ripping off its brand. At the center of the case is a squeaky toy created by VIP Products that is strikingly similar to Jack Daniel\u2019s bottles, with a black label and similar font style. The distiller argues that the toy, with its poop-themed jokes, damages its reputation. VIP Products, on the other hand, argues consumers can easily distinguish between Jack Daniel\u2019s and their parodied dog toy. Depending on how the high court rules, the case could have major implications on trademark protections for companies that use other brand logos to express humor.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nJapan defeats Team USA in World Baseball Classic final\n\nThe dramatic ending of Tuesday\u2019s championship game left fans ecstatic inside loanDepot Park in Miami.\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal shares reason for his hospitalization\n\nGood news: Shaq is on his way back \u2013 to the sports desk, that is.

        "title": "How safe is Chennai if an earthquake strikes?",
        "description": "CHENNAI: Can Chennai withstand an earthquake of 7. 8 magnitude that recently hit Turkey? According to a study, nearly 60% of localities of the city are at risk if an earthquake strikes, and nearly 53% of the city\u2019s population is likely to be affected.A team from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), assessed and mapped \u2018liquefaction\u2019, which is a loosely packed sediment near the surface that can lose strength when earth shakes, in the city. They found that many localities have soil conditions such as sand, silt and charnockite and high or shallow groundwater table that can lead to liquefaction during an earthquake.Researchers said liquefaction is \u2018likely\u2019 to occur in localities close to the coast from Ennore to Kanathur as well as interior areas like Vyasarpadi, Chetpet, Teynampet, T Nagar , Kotturpuram and Sholinganallur , apart from Taramani, Saligramam, Anna Nagar west, Koyambedu and Porur. Chennai was moved up from seismic zone two to three in 2002, after the Bhuj earthquake, after the city was found to be more vulnerable to earthquakes.Prof G P Ganapathy , Centre for Disaster Mitigation and Management, VIT, who was involved in the study, said seismic waves travel faster in rocky soil, moderately fast in sandy soil and die in clayey soil. The city has a combination of soil conditions with varying thickness and different water table depths. \u201cThere should be an earthquake of magnitude six or above in the vicinity of a site for liquefaction to happen. But that does not mean all areas mapped as \u2018liquefaction prone\u2019 will face damage. If there\u2019s a six magnitude earthquake and a particular area has a shallow water table and sandy soil, it may liquify. Our study is preliminary and was studied over a larger area. The parameters like soil type may vary if you study a specific site,\u201d he said. \u201cSite specific studies could be done with standard penetration tests, core penetration test and MASW which gives you the type and thickness of the soil as well as behaviour of soil towards seismic waves,\u201d he added.The mapping showed that areas along the coast from Tiruvottiyur to Injambakkam and interior areas like Vyasarpadi, Purasaiwalkam, Chetpet, Teynampet and T Nagar have a combination of black clay and sandy soil, while areas on the west of Chennai like Anna Nagar, Koyembedu, Villivakkam, Porur and Nolambur have a combination of clay and silt. Areas like Velachery, Meenambakkam and parts of Guindy have charnockite soil.However, some geophysicists said Chennai and most parts of southern regions fall under seismic zone 2 and 3 and may not face any high intensity earthquake.\u201cLocally there are chances of earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 4 and not more in the southern region. They may not be dangerous,\u201d said Ajay Kumar B, geophysicist, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services.",

        "description": "On 6 February 2023, twin earthquakes struck 11 provinces in T\u00fcrkiye, killing more than 43,000 people and injuring many others. Civil society organizations, volunteers and public institutions, particularly those already in the region, deployed immediately to the cities to support survivors of the disaster, in which hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes and loved ones.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Center Foundation (KAMER), a women\u2019s organization founded in 2005 in Diyarbak\u0131r\u2014one of the provinces hit by the earthquakes\u2014has been working tirelessly over the last couple of weeks. KAMER has managed to quickly reach thousands of people in need in earthquake zones through its extensive network and 21 branches in southeast T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nNebahat Akko\u00e7, Chairperson of KAMER, says they are distributing aid packages daily, which contain sanitary pads, underwear, diapers and other essential items for women and girls. \u201cDue to social norms, women in the region are embarrassed to ask for hygiene products, such as pads and underwear. Many women and girls are calling us to ask for such needs because we are a women\u2019s organization, so they know they can talk about their needs more freely. We also collaborate with public institutions and inform them about the needs and requests women are approaching us with. As a women\u2019s organization, we are in the field, and we advocate for the rights of all women and girls,\u201d says Akko\u00e7.\n\nThrough UN Women\u2019s support, the foundation has been implementing the \u201cWe Are Here, Too\u201d project for the past 14 months. Akko\u00e7 says they have now redirected this funding to support to women in grief and despair and struggling with trauma caused by the earthquake.\n\n\u201cThere is a very urgent need for psychological support in the region,\u201d explains Akko\u00e7. \u201cWomen and girls have lost their loved ones and homes. Suddenly, their lives have dramatically changed. Our support will hopefully help women to recover from their traumas. But much more is needed.\u201d\n\nThrough its multilingual and online psychological consultancy network, the foundation is providing psychological support to women survivors of the earthquake who were already suffering multi-dimensional poverty as a result of being deprived of educational rights, having low levels of income, lacking access to equal opportunities, and facing communication problems due to language barriers.\n\n\u201cNatural disasters can negatively affect an individual\u2019s physical, social, emotional and spiritual well-being. Psychological support is very important for earthquake survivors who struggle to cope with their trauma. But the healing process is long-term,\u201d says Sevil Bremer, a psychologist and psychotherapist who, alongside a team of 10 psychologists, has been supporting women from day one as part of KAMER\u2019s response. Bremer, who also supervises the psychologists, adds: \u201cWe started psychological support with psychologists who are also survivors of the earthquake. We identified their professional needs, useful psychological tools and methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen survivors of earthquakes are affected differently because of the daily problems they experience due to existing inequalities,\u201d Bremer says. \u201cTherefore, thinking about the different needs of women and girls is vital for an effective response and recovery.\u201d",

With favorable exchange rates sweetening the deal for visitors, the country\u2019s beautiful beaches, historic cities and geological wonders were poised for a post-pandemic tourism revival.\n\nThen disaster struck. On February 6, a massive earthquake close to Turkey\u2019s border with Syria caused major loss of life and leveled entire neighborhoods.

Tourism is hugely important for Turkey\u2019s economy and the livelihoods of many depend on it. After Covid, visitors were needed more than ever.\n\nTourist reticence in the wake of a disaster is understandable. Vacationers tend to see news footage of any disaster zone and equate that with the country as a whole \u2013 even when that country is as geographically extensive as Turkey.\n\nThey will inevitably have questions. Is there any ongoing danger? Will they be a burden on their hosts at a time when the country is trying to recover? Will they be welcome? Understandably, they also want to know if they\u2019ll still have a good time.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Turkey \u2013 also known as T\u00fcrkiye \u2013 will be entering the start of its peak tourism season. With some reporting cancellations in the initial days and weeks after the earthquake, the country\u2019s travel industry will be holding its breath.\n\nSigns are good, says Kaan Kavalo\u011flu, chair of the Mediterranean Touristic Hoteliers Association. With flights operating as normal to most major destinations, and resorts and businesses all open, he\u2019s confident the country is still in for a better year.\n\n\u201cWe are in close contact with the tour operators of different countries and OTA [online travel agency] colleagues, who confirm that T\u00fcrkiye is gearing up for another record-breaking summer season at all of its major destinations,\u201d he told CNN Travel.\n\nTo gauge what\u2019s happening on the ground and the kinds of welcome tourists can expect in some of Turkey\u2019s leading destinations, CNN also spoke to those working to offer hotel, museum, shopping, yachting and other experiences to travelers.\n\nIstanbul\n\nIstanbul is the epitome of Turkish culture and is the gateway to the country for many.\n\nIt\u2019s among the world\u2019s leading travel destinations, where international visitors in 2022 spent more than $13 billion, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.\n\nLike most of Turkey\u2019s prime tourist spots, Istanbul felt the shockwaves of the February 6 earthquake but sustained no damage. The city, home to 15 million residents, lies more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the quake\u2019s epicenter.\n\nAt \u00c7ukurcuma Hamam\u0131, a luxury bath house that has been welcoming visitors and locals into its steamy embrace since 1831, manager B\u00fcke Yurdado\u011f is among many working in the travel industry concerned that the quake will scare away tourists.\n\nWhile she, like others, is still reeling from the scale of the tragedy and shares concerns for its victims, there\u2019s worry that tourists will strike Istanbul from their itineraries because of recent events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently entering the high tourist season in Istanbul and compared to last year, there is a decrease in business, even if it\u2019s a small one,\u201d says Yurdado\u011f.\n\nIstanbul: New mysteries around every corner. Nikolay N. Antonov/Adobe Stock\n\n\u201cThe earthquake has, of course, affected us all, both personally and as a business. We\u2019re trying to help the affected provinces as much as we can while also striving to welcome guests to our hamam in the best way possible.\n\n\u201cNatural disasters are an inevitable fact of our world and Istanbul is a city that has existed for centuries and has hosted dozens of cultures and civilizations in the midst of this reality.\u201d\n\nTourists, says Yurdado\u011f, will still be beguiled by the variety of what Istanbul has to offer.\n\n\u201cIt is a city that may appear chaotic from afar, but when visitors come here and begin to explore, they discover new mysteries at every corner. From the historic peninsula to Balat to Galata and to Moda, I think every neighborhood has something that attracts the interests of every traveler.\u201d\n\nShe recommends the antique shops of \u00c7ukurcuma, the Sveti Stefan Church in Balat, the alleys around the Galata Tower, the Bosphorus Strait, the Sak\u0131p Sabanc\u0131 Museum overlooking the Bosphorus view, the Ye\u015filk\u00f6y waterfront and its fishermen, and the Moda and Kuzguncuk neighborhoods.\n\nAntalya\n\nAntalya, on Turkey\u2019s southern Mediterranean coast, may be synonymous with resort vacations by its beach, but the city and province are destinations for history buffs and the nearby Taurus Mountains draw hikers. There are also quiet beach towns.\n\nAt the Olympos Mountain Lodge, a boutique hotel in the Antalya village of Beycik, owner and chef Mehmet Ali B\u00f6rt\u00fccene presides over a refined eatery that focuses on seasonal produce.\n\nB\u00f6rt\u00fccene says the quake has had a significant impact on Antalya, which lies more than 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the epicenter, with tourist bookings down. Yet, he adds, visitors will help quake survivors.\n\nAntalya has welcomed many quake survivors. saiko3p/Adobe Stock\n\n\u201cAfter the disaster, Antalya welcomed many earthquake victims who were left homeless and unemployed,\u201d he says. \u201cTourists who come to this region will indirectly contribute to the healing process.\n\n\u201cTourism is one of Turkey\u2019s most important sources of income and so every tourist who comes here actually helps in the alleviation of this trauma. After the earthquake, tourism decreased in the Antalya region, the sadness that people felt naturally reduced our work considerably,\u201d says B\u00f6rt\u00fccene.\n\nHe says visitors to Beycik and Antalya will enjoy not only its coast but also pine, juniper and cedar forests and the ancient ruins of \u00c7\u0131ral\u0131, Olympos and Phaselis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Lycian Way, a marked long-distance hiking trail all along the coast with stunning views, the historic Gelidonya Lighthouse and pristine natural beauties such as the Be\u015f Adalar Island and the \u00dc\u00e7oluk highland village.\u201d\n\nBodrum\n\nBodrum is synonymous with Turkey\u2019s \u201cTurquoise Coast,\u201d a summer hotspot of luxury resorts and nightclubs but also of quieter seaside villages with humble seafood restaurants where evenings can be spent watching the moon reflect on calm waters.\n\nInside Bodrum\u2019s bazaar, Gallery Mustafa owner Mustafa A\u00e7\u0131kel and his son Murat sell hand-embroidered rugs, kilims and cushion covers. A\u00e7\u0131kel says the quake has prompted concerned calls from regular clients but hopes tourism won\u2019t take a hit.\n\n\u201cThe earthquake affected us all emotionally,\u201d he says. \u201cHere in Bodrum people sent as much aid as possible to the affected areas and hotels opened their doors for the victims.\n\n\u201cThe Aegean region may be on the earthquake fault line but we can\u2019t say that it has adversely affected tourism. Our customers abroad called us to ask about the situation in the country but all plan to come in the summer.\n\nBodrum mixes luxury resorts with quiet seaside villages. pikoso.kz/Adobe Stock\n\n\u201cEconomically speaking, tourism is one of Turkey\u2019s biggest sources of income and so we need tourists to visit each year. We have a lot of workers who make a living from tourism, in every region in Turkey,\u201d he adds.\n\nA\u00e7\u0131kel says visitors to Bodrum this year can find luxury and entertainment as well as a quiet and calm getaway. His highlights include a visit to Bodrum Castle, and the Theater and Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.\n\n\u201cI recommend a blue cruise for those who have time; visiting the food market on Fridays for the best organic produce; walking among the tangerine orchards in Bitez village; eating lunch at K\u00f6fteci Bilal\u2019in Yeri and Sakall\u0131 Restaurant in the bazaar.\n\nAlso on his list, seafood at the K\u00f6rfez and Gemiba\u015f\u0131 restaurants, enjoying homemade dishes at K\u0131smet restaurant in Konac\u0131k and visiting the Dibeklihan Culture and Art Village and the beautiful garden and library at Zai Bodrum.\n\nIzmir\n\nTurkey\u2019s third most populous city, Izmir is also one of its most liberal, attracting summer crowds who like to hang out in the fashionable town of Ala\u00e7at\u0131, go dancing at the beach clubs in \u00c7e\u015fme or wine tasting in Urla.\n\nInside six historic, renovated stone houses, Alavya is one of Izmir\u2019s most exclusive boutique hotels. Zeynep \u00c7ift\u00e7io\u011flu \u0130pek\u00e7i, who works as its media and communications director, says bookings wavered after the disaster but not significantly.\n\n\u201cEven though Izmir is far away from the provinces affected by the earthquake, we were overcome with deep sadness,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, we are making an effort to continue our work and to foster the peace, calmness and love that is the essence of Alavya.\n\nIzmir is one of Turkey's most liberal cities. HSNY Photography/Adobe Stock\n\n\u201cOf course, we have had some cancellations, but the majority of our guests have continued to come,\u201d says \u00c7ift\u00e7io\u011flu \u0130pek\u00e7i.\n\nShe says visitors to Ala\u00e7at\u0131 will appreciate its historic cobblestoned streets, windmills, turquoise waters and summer wind breezes, as well as local produce.\n\n\u201cThe Aegean kitchen, with its appetizers, herbs, desserts as well as the \u00c7e\u015fme melon, the Izmir fig and the Ala\u00e7at\u0131 artichoke are some of the most beautiful flavors in the world,\u201d says \u00c7ift\u00e7io\u011flu.\n\n\u201cApart from UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as Ephesus and Bergama, Izmir has Seferihisar, Turkey\u2019s first slow city (Cittaslow), the natural beauties of Karaburun, the seaside village of Ild\u0131r, the historic Birgi village and the beautiful bays, vineyards and fish restaurants on the road between Izmir city and Ala\u00e7at\u0131.\u201d\n\nCanakkle\n\n\u00c7anakkale, on the southern shores of the Dardanelles Strait dividing Europe and Asia, is steeped in history. It\u2019s known for the ancient city of Troy and the Martyrs\u2019 Memorial to Turkish soldiers who died at nearby Gallipoli in World War I.\n\nCompleted by Yal\u0131n Architectural Design in 2018, the Museum of Troy appears like an extraterrestrial cube out in the vast countryside, covered in a rusted metal facade.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep sadness in \u00c7anakkale and all over Turkey because of this great disaster,\u201d says R\u0131dvan G\u00f6lc\u00fck, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cAfter the earthquake, an important example of solidarity and mobilization was shown to collect aid for the affected regions.\u201d\n\nThe \u00c7anakkale Martyrs' Memorial commemorates Turkish soldiers who participated in the Battle of Gallipoli. ibrahim kiroglu/Adobe Stock\n\nG\u00f6lc\u00fck says his museum has launched workshops to help rehabilitate families, including children who have moved to \u00c7anakkale from quake-hit areas.\n\n\u201cWe believe museums play an essential role in helping children face the future with confidence,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition to his museum, G\u00f6lc\u00fck says visitors should explore the nearby ruins of ancient Troy, the Martyrs\u2019 Memorial and watch the sunset at the Sanctuary of Athena at Assos.\n\nAlso on his list is the island of Bozcaada, a short ferry ride away, Mount Ida (Kaz Da\u011flar\u0131). Visitors can also sample wine from Bozcaada and cheese from Ezine.\n\n\u201cTourism is important for Turkey, but not just because of economic factors,\u201d G\u00f6lc\u00fck adds. \u201cIt is also a way for us to share our story, a form of communication that also allows us to write the story of our future together.\u201d\n\nCappadocia\n\nA mystical landscape of wind-carved \u201cfairy chimneys,\u201d rock-cut churches and underground cities, Cappadocia is like nowhere else on Earth.\n\nInside a restored former monastery complex consisting of underground tunnels and houses, is Argos in Cappadocia, an award-winning hotel overlooking the popular trekking site of Pigeon Valley.\n\nSituated just 300 kilometers (close to 190 miles) from the quake zone, Cappadocia is perfectly safe, the hotel\u2019s manager, Deniz Kark\u0131n, insists.\n\n\u201cWhen considering the scientific data, Cappadocia is one of the regions in Turkey with the lowest earthquake risk,\u201d he says. \u201cGuests who are planning to visit Turkey can choose Cappadocia for their travels with peace of mind.\u201d\n\nCappadocia is famous for its \"fairy chimney\" landscapes. Ivan Kmit/Adobe Stock\n\nThe region\u2019s landscape is the main draw for visitors, but the history of those who have carved their homes in the soft flanks of its cliffs are just as fascinating.\n\n\u201cCappadocia is like something out of a fairy tale, a settlement where underground cities were carved out thousands of years ago,\u201d says Kark\u0131n. It\u2019s also known for its wines and as a cradle of Christianity.\n\n\u201cGuests who come here experience the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the G\u00f6reme Open Air Museum, the underground cities of Kaymakl\u0131 and Derinkuyu, the Pa\u015faba\u011f Valley with its fairy chimneys, and the Love and K\u0131z\u0131l\u00e7ukur Valleys, which have the most stunning sunsets.\n\n\u201cEvery morning the sky is colored with hundreds of hot-air balloons, offering guests a chance to see and photograph Cappadocia from above.\u201d\n\nFethiye\n\nAnother tourist hotspot along the Turkish Riviera, Fethiye is known for its beaches, but historic sites such as the abandoned Greek village of Kayak\u00f6y give it a mysterious flair.\n\nThe small town of G\u00f6cek is a hub for yacht tourism. In one of its many marinas, Irmak Y\u00fcksel and her family offer bareboat and skippered charters.\n\nY\u00fcksel says she\u2019s optimistic of good times ahead. Visitors, she adds, should have no fears for safety.\n\n\u201cTurkey is an earthquake-prone country so what\u2019s important is that structures are sturdy and built according to code,\u201d she says. \u201cIn light of this, I don\u2019t think there is any heightened risk here in the Fethiye region.\n\nFethiye is known for its beaches. KenanOlgun/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\u201cLike every sector, we were also deeply saddened and affected by the earthquake. Despite the fact that our excitement and enthusiasm was a bit broken, we are looking forward to hosting guests for the upcoming summer season.\u201d\n\n\u201cG\u00f6cek is, of course, my favorite place in Fethiye because of the work we do. It has these beautiful bays that seem to have been made by hand like lacework. It is a unique town with lush nature, sailing tourism and an elite atmosphere\u201d says Y\u00fcksel.\n\n\u201cApart from taking a boat tour and going paragliding, tourists coming to Fethiye should visit the historic Kayak\u00f6y village, the ancient Greek Amyntas Rock Tombs, the Sakl\u0131kent National Park with its famous canyon, the \u00d6l\u00fcdeniz Beach and hike part of the Lycian Way.\u201d\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have launched two emergency appeals with a total value of 200 million Swiss francs (around $214 million) to help relief efforts in both countries.\n\nThere are many other organizations who are also on the ground responding.

        "description": "This report is produced by the OCHA mission in T\u00fcrkiye in collaboration with humanitarian partners and covers the humanitarian situation and earthquake response in T\u00fcrkiye. Updates provided on emergency response activities reflect a summary snapshot rather than an exhaustive representation on all ongoing response efforts\n\nHighlights\n\n\u2022 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on 6 March that the death toll from the deadly earthquakes has risen to 46,104.\n\n\u2022 He said the number of collapsed and heavily damaged buildings in 11 provinces in the earthquake zone reached 230 thousand.\n\n\u2022 The President added that currently 3 million 320 thousand people were evacuated from the earthquake zone and went to other provinces, while 800 thousand people in the region took shelter in their villages.\n\n\u2022 Human mobility remains a key characteristic of this disaster. IOM reports that over 2.7 million people have been displaced in T\u00fcrkiye by the earthquake. A majority of these individuals are living in temporary settlements, half of which are classified as informal. Due to the scale of the crisis, temporary settlements lack access to safe and dignified water and sanitation, health care and other essential services.\n\n\u2022 On 2 March, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) reported that the total number of people who were given shelter in the region affected by the earthquake is 1,593,808. In other provinces, a total of 329,960 people affected by the disaster are provided with accommodation services, bringing the total number of people provided with shelter and accommodation to more than 1.9 million.\n\n\u2022 As of 8 March, IFRC, IOM, UNHCR and UNICEF have together provided more than 42 thousand tents, along with more than 124 thousand bedsheets by IOM. IFRC, IOM and UNHCR have provided more than 278 thousand blankets and more than 181 thousand mattresses as well as a variety of other critical items, including kitchen sets and tarpaulins.\n\n\u2022 IOM alone dispatched more than 977 thousand non-food items, including blankets, mattresses, winter clothes and kitchen sets, to an estimated 1.4 million people.\n\n\u2022 WFP has provided more than 5,7 million food packages and hot meals as of 8 March. WFP and its partners have provided food assistance to over 900 thousand people.\n\n\u2022 WHO's Emergency Medical Teams initiative has provided essential healthcare to 23,986 injured and vulnerable people affected by the disaster.\n\n\u2022 As of 01 March, UNICEF has reached nearly 319,000 people, including over 183,000 children, with critical supplies including hygiene kits and non-food items such as winter clothes, electrical heaters, blankets etc.\n\n\u2022 UNFPA supported around 8,900 individuals with life-saving assistance for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and violence against women, girls and other individuals in situations of vulnerability, including dignity and maternity kits.\n\n\u2022 A long-term needs assessment led by the Government with support from UNDP, the World Bank and the European Union (EU) counts the earthquake damages at over US$100 billion.\n\n\u2022 On 8 March, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, Senior Response Coordinator for T\u00fcrkiye, joined UN Women in marking International Women\u2019s Day by meeting with women frontliners, community leaders, and civil society organization representatives in Islahiye, a town in Gaziantep affected by the earthquakes. While the earthquake increased the existing inequalities, women were on the ground from day one as frontliners. The women responders highlighted the immediate and longer-term specific needs of women and girls, including safety and privacy, hygiene, psychosocial support and livelihood opportunities.",

        "description": "An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude has hit eastern Tajikistan on Thursday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake struck around 5.37 am local time at a depth of about 20.5 kilometres.\n\nThe epicentre appeared to be in Gorno-Badakhshan, a semi-autonomous eastern region that borders Afghanistan and China, about 67 kilometres from the small mountain town of Murghob, as per AFP reports.\n\nA 5.0-magnitude aftershock hit the area about 20 minutes after the initial quake, followed by a 4.6-magnitude quake.\n\nThe agency estimated that \u2018little or no population\u2019 would be exposed to landslides from the earthquake.\n\nThe territory is surrounded by the towering Pamir Mountains and is home to Lake Sarez. The aquamarine-coloured body of water, formed as a result of an earthquake in 1911, is among Tajikistan's largest lakes.\n\nLocated behind Lake Sarez is a natural dam deep in the Pamir mountains, and experts have warned the consequences will be catastrophic if the dam is breached.\n\nTajikistan is highly prone to natural disasters and has a long history of floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches and heavy snowfalls.\n\nEarlier this month, nine people died in a February 15 avalanche in Gorno-Badakhshan, while another person was killed the same day in an avalanche on a highway near the capital Dushanbe.\n\nMeanwhile, a massive earthquake killed more than 47,000 people and damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes in Turkey and Syria. After two weeks, the countries were again hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake which killed six people.\n\nIt was followed by 90 aftershocks, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said, adding fresh trauma to Antakya residents left homeless and living in tents by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on February 6.\n\n(With AFP inputs)",

The shelters, built by NATO\u2019s Support and Procurement Agency, include heating, power generators and medical treatment areas. The camp in Antakya is on track to welcome 2,400 displaced people by mid-April 2023. NATO Allies also recently agreed to provide temporary housing for an additional 4,000 people in Defne.\n\nAs part of a NATO-coordinated air-bridge, Allies and partners have flown around 10,000 tents, blankets and pieces of medical equipment from Pakistan to T\u00fcrkiye in recent weeks. In early March, France delivered 5,000 tents and thousands of blankets. Thousands of emergency responders from across the Alliance as well as from invitees Finland and Sweden and NATO partner Japan, have been engaged in the initial international relief efforts. Allied armed forces have also set up field clinics in T\u00fcrkiye for quake victims. The earthquakes that struck T\u00fcrkiye earlier this year were the deadliest natural disaster on Alliance territory since NATO\u2019s foundation.",

Turkey Earthquake: A rescue worker digs to reach a boy under the rubble.(AFP)\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was the \"worst natural disaster\" in the European region for a century.\n\nOne month on, Turkey is facing the daunting task of rebuilding flattened cities, with tens of thousands buried and many survivors barely subsisting in tents or containers.\n\nLoss\n\nThe country's death toll from the quake has risen to 45,968, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Saturday, with 4,267 of the dead Syrian refugees who fled the civil war in their country. Thousands more in Syria have died.\n\nThe earthquake struck 11 Turkish provinces at 4:17am local time as people slept in homes not built to withstand powerful tremors.\n\nRead more: Revenge poisoning?

More than 1.4 million have been resettled in tents and nearly 46,000 in container cities, while the rest have been settled in dormitories and guesthouses, according to official figures.\n\nFrustration\n\nThere has been mounting frustration at the government over its handling of the disaster. Erdogan has blamed severe winter conditions that covered major roads in ice and snow, damaged roads and inoperable airports.\n\nIn some provinces, including Adiyaman, anger at the state remains strong. Survivors told AFP they had been left to save loved ones trapped under the rubble with their bare hands because there were no rescue teams, soldiers or police for days after the quake.",

        "title": "Millions of tons of earthquake rubble await removal in T\u00fcrkiye",
        "description": "Ankara, 24 February 2023 \u2013 Clearing away the mountains of rubble generated when thousands of buildings collapsed in the devastating earthquakes that hit the Southeast region on 6 and 20 February 2023 is the top-priority area of support mapped out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its response to the disaster. Rubble removal accounts for a large share of UNDP\u2019s US$113.5 million request for funding, which was issued as a part of the broader US$1 billion UN \u201cflash appeal\u201d that was circulated for donor support on 16 February 2023.\n\n\u201cAt UNDP our focus is on early recovery,\u201d said UNDP Resident Representative Louisa Vinton. \u201cWhile supporting the emergency response, we look ahead to the massive effort that will be needed to restore normal life in the area. Clearing rubble is a vital first step, but we need to show reverence for the human lives and dreams that lie buried.\u201d\n\nUNDP\u2019s current focus is to help prevent public health threats to affected populations and emergency responders. As a first measure, UNDP has sent 160 770-liter dumpster-size waste bins; 54,000 kg of quicklime; and 10,400 liters of disinfectant to Hatay Metropolitan Municipality. These commodities will support municipal authorities in collecting and moving waste; sanitizing the rubble; and compensating for the current lack of clean water for drinking and washing. These supplies were delivered on 20 and 21 February 2023, with more support to follow.\n\nUNDP will soon deliver portable toilets and urgently needed additional waste collection supplies to the affected communities while also working to repair some of the most urgently needed damaged water utilities. A shipment of containers is also on its way to Hatay Metropolitan Municipality for use as storage for emergency goods.\n\nBeyond these emergency measures, UNDP is planning to support the Government in addressing the daunting task of debris management and rubble removal. According to the Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, of the more than one million structures inspected so far, 156,000 buildings containing 507,000 separate homes and offices have either completely collapsed or are so damaged they will require demolition.\n\nUNDP\u2019s early estimates indicate that the disaster has generated between 116 million and 210 million tons of rubble. For comparison, the 1999 Marmara earthquake generated around 13 million tons of rubble.\n\n\u201cThe scope of the challenge is almost beyond comprehension,\u201d said UNDP\u2019s Vinton. \u201cTo help visualize the total volume of what needs to be removed, imagine an area of 10 km by 10 km covered in debris piled one meter high.\u201d Envisaged this way, the estimated area of debris \u2013 100 sq km \u2013 is bigger than Manhattan, which covers 59 sq km.\n\nUNDP estimates that the destruction has left 1.5 million people homeless and will require the construction of 500,000 new housing units to compensate. Rubble will have to be removed first \u2013 to clear the way for vital deliveries of food, water and other supplies, and to begin the restoration of normal social and economic activities.\n\nIn supporting the Government response, UNDP aims to promote an environmentally friendly approach to rubble management, recycling the raw materials it contains, rather than simply dumping debris. At the same time, UNDP will work to generate livelihood opportunities, by employing local residents to help move and process the rubble.\n\nUNDP will draw on its experience in responding to earthquakes in other locations, including Haiti, Nepal and Pakistan; to the massive explosion in Beirut in 2020; and to war destruction caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In Nepal, for example, UNDP recycled 90 percent of the rubble from the damaged areas it managed.\n\nRubble removal is just one of several areas where UNDP aims to work in support of its government partners in the early recovery phase. UNDP also aims to help restore livelihoods and revive small businesses; to assist local authorities in providing key social services, including psychosocial support; and to help protect damaged and endangered cultural heritage monuments in an area that features many priceless treasures of ancient civilizations.",

        "title": "Syrian women find strength in the aftermath of the earthquake",
        "description": "As the world marks International Women\u2019s Day on Wednesday, women in Syria are facing trauma and displacement.\n\nIdlib, Syria \u2013 A month after devastating earthquakes struck northern Syria, Moufida Ghanem is mourning the loss of a son and the destruction of her home, which collapsed on her and her two boys, breaking her leg and killing her 18-year-old son.\n\nRescued from under the rubble with her 15-year-old son, Ali, the 40-year-old widow now finds herself having to cope with yet another loss. But she has been able to rise to every challenge so far.\n\n\u201cFor the past six years, I have been the mother and father at home,\u201d she told Al Jazeera from a tented encampment in Azmarin, Idlib province. \u201cNow I have to be a mother, father and brother for my son.\u201d\n\nWhen her recovery is complete, Ghanem said, she will look for work to try to provide a \u200b\u200b\u201ddecent life\u201d for what remains of her family.\n\nAs the world marks International Women\u2019s Day on Wednesday, a number of remarkable portraits of women\u2019s strength are emerging from northwest Syria as it struggles to recover from the massive earthquakes.\n\nSingle or widowed women like Ghanem find themselves forced to live in overcrowded encampments where humanitarian organisations say they are at heightened risk of harassment and abuse.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) has found that more than 60 percent of the surveyed households had a head of household defined as a person at risk, including female-headed households.\n\n\u201cWomen and girls told us they do not feel safe going to the bathroom in overcrowded collective shelters,\u201d Elias Abu Ata, communications officer at IRC, told Al Jazeera. \u201cSome reported harassment.\u201d\n\nMost available shelter options also lack essential facilities like bathrooms and toilets, which has a disproportionate effect on the safety of women and girls.\n\nMore than 8.8 million people have been affected by the quakes across Syria, according to United Nations figures, and more than 105,000 people have been displaced.\n\n\u2018A sublime mission\u2019\n\nLast month\u2019s devastation has made the roles women already play much more important.\n\nAbout a month before the earthquake, Iman Abdel Razzaq, 44, had quit her job as a paediatric nurse to undergo vascular surgery on her foot. But when the mother of four saw the scale of destruction and the needs that came with it, she set up a medical centre to treat people free of charge, partnering with a number of her colleagues who pitched in all the medical equipment they owned.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Jandaris was apocalyptic, people were terrified, children were crying everywhere and we could hear the moans and groans coming from under the houses that had fallen on the families living there,\u201d Abdel Razzaq told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cI was afraid after the earthquake, but I only thought of how I could help people,\u201d she said, adding that their clinic receives at least 80 children daily in addition to men and women who need care and some pregnant women who need emergency deliveries.\n\nIman and her colleagues have managed to keep the project going from the day they set it up, right after the earthquakes. \u201cOur work is voluntary and individual as we strive to provide free healthcare to people who need it. We rely on individual donations to buy more supplies for the clinic and haven\u2019t received support from any organisations or authorities,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the work ever overwhelms her, she answered: \u201cI gain my strength from working because I consider medical and humanitarian work to be a sublime mission, it is saving lives and helping people.\u201d\n\n\u2018My son asks me if the next shock will kill us\u2019\n\nThe female health professionals in northwest Syria are very busy taking care of others, and they also have to deal with the trauma their own children went through.\n\n\u201cWhen I come home, the first thing my seven-year-old son asks me is if we will die when another shock occurs,\u201d Shahd al-Abdullah, a 29-year-old medical services volunteer with the Syria Civil Defence, a rescue group operating in opposition-held parts of Syria also known as the White Helmets, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe IRC survey found two in three children showed signs of psychological distress, such as increased crying, sadness and nightmares, with more than half of the households interviewed saying their children were having nightmares.\n\nAl-Abdullah used to live in Saraqeb, east of Idlib, but moved to Qorqanya to live with her parents after being displaced by war in 2019.\n\nHer mother had woken up when the earthquake hit, and started shouting at everyone to get out of the house, al-Abdullah recalled, so she grabbed her son in her arms and made her way out into the street, surrounded by the bewildered faces of her neighbours.\n\n\u201cI waited a little for the aftershocks to calm down then I left my son with my parents and headed to the Civil Defence centre. As I walked along, I was astounded at the level of destruction and the number of people out in the street in the rain and freezing wind; none of them knew what to do,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause the scale was so huge, the Civil Defence volunteers were not confined to working in their original roles. \u201cMy specialisation is emergency care, but I was working with the search and rescue teams to find people stuck under the rubble as well as offering them emergency care at the medical centres,\u201d al-Abdullah explained.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that happened that I won\u2019t be able to forget is that one day we rescued a pregnant woman from under the rubble. She was still alive when we put her in the ambulance so she could go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cShe grabbed my hand and said: \u2018Don\u2019t leave me, I\u2019m frightened for the baby.\u2019 I was trying to calm her down the whole way to the hospital but sadly once we arrived we realised that she had lost the baby. In addition to that, she had extreme injuries to her bones that resulted in her paralysis,\u201d al-Abdullah said sadly.\n\nThe Civil Defence teams have been working nonstop since the earthquakes, and among the things that Shahd and her colleagues do is to head out to the camps to offer medical care to the survivors living there. \u201cWe try to reassure these people, some of whom live in terrible conditions, that the Civil Defence is here for them and will not abandon them and that we will help as much as we can,\u201d al-Abdullah continued.\n\n\u201cWe have proven, as women, that we can work in the most difficult conditions and in all fields. Women now work in the Civil Defence, and in the medical and humanitarian fields, they\u2019re making a difference everywhere, in most civil society organisations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Indescribable feelings\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the destruction that impacted so many of the people of Jinderes and Afrin, I was deeply affected and really wanted to help somehow, no matter how small my contribution would be,\u201d 22-year-old artist Yasmine Khalil told Al Jazeera.\n\nFor her, healing the psychological wounds left by the tragedy is the most important thing.\n\n\u201cI only have my brushes and my colours to help people with, so I started working on paintings that showed the painful reality we were living in Jandaris,\u201d she said. The paintings show the destroyed buildings as smoke and dust rise.\n\n\u201cIn one of the paintings, a woman is crying and screaming as she emerges from the rubble clutching her dead son to her chest.\u201d\n\nYasmine wanted to sell her paintings to raise money to help shelter or support at least one family in the stricken area. So she held a live auction online and ended up raising nearly 6,000 euros ($6,300).\n\n\u201cMy dream had been to sell all my paintings to raise even just enough money to help one affected family. I could never have imagined that I would end up raising this much. This money that was raised could help set up tents to shelter nearly 50 families.\n\n\u201cMy feelings are indescribable,\u201d she said. \u201cWith my brush and colours, I managed to contribute to the relief of the afflicted.\u201d",

The reason behind his prediction according to Rao is because of the movement of the Indian tectonic plate which moves about five cms every year and is leading to the accumulation of stress along the Himalayas which could result in a massive earthquake.In an interview with ANI, Dr. N Rao said, \u201cEarth\u2019s surface comprises various plates that are constantly in motion. The Indian plate is moving about 5 cm per year, leading to accumulation of stress along the Himalayas increasing the possibility of a greater earthquake.\u201dHe said, \u201cThe region referred to as the seismic gap between Himachal and the western part of Nepal including Uttarakhand is prone to earthquakes that might occur at any time.\u201d He also noted that Uttarakhand is equipped with a strong network of 18 seismograph stations to monitor ground motions.The terrifying prediction comes on the heels of the massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey and Syria which till date has killed almost 45,000 people and is recorded to be one of the deadliest natural disasters in the past century.The occurrence of such massive destruction has led to nations questioning their preparedness on risk management, research and development of relief funds, knowledge gaps among many other things.Before the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, Frank Hoogerbeets, a Dutch researcher had reportedly predicted the quakes in Turkey and Syria - which saw a massive 7-8-magnitude earthquake on February 6 - three days ago. His tweet had also gone viral at that time.According to another viral post sharing a video of the researcher explaining the danger stated, \u201cDutch researcher Frank Hoogerbeets who anticipated the quake in Turkey and Syria three days ago had also predicted seismic activity anticipating a large size earthquake originating in Afghanistan, through Pakistan and India eventually terminating into the Indian Ocean\u201d.However, Twitter users flagged the post stating that there is no scientific basis for earthquake predictions.While Turkey\u2019s Anatolian plate- being of the most active seismic zones - makes it among the most earthquake-prone countries, as per National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the entire Himalayan belt is also considered prone to great earthquakes of magnitude exceeding 8.0 with as much as 59% of India\u2019s land mass is prone to earthquakes of different intensities.",

        "description": "A swarm of earthquakes is proving unsettling for those in Bay of Plenty. Photo / GeoNet\n\nA swarm of earthquakes is proving unsettling for those in Bay of Plenty. Photo / GeoNet\n\nBy RNZ\n\nThe swarm of earthquakes plaguing Bay of Plenty residents could continue for weeks, a GNS seismologist says.\n\nHundreds of tremors have been occurring over the last few days, with the largest a 4.8 magnitude shake.\n\nSome Kawerau businesses had to shut down, with stock repeatedly thrown from shelves, and some people decided to leave for a few days until the shaking stops.\n\nA crack may have formed in the side of nearby Mt Putauaki, a dormant volcano on the edge of the Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone.\n\nThe Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS) said earthquake swarms were quite common in New Zealand.\n\nWhile the current frequent quakes were unsettling for those across the Bay of Plenty region, they were reminiscent of similar events in 2018 and 2019, it said.\n\nDuty seismologist John Ristau told Morning Report the usual earthquake pattern was one big quake followed by a group of aftershocks until activity tapered off over time.\n\nBut the Bay of Plenty region is experiencing a swarm - a series of earthquakes of similar size and which are often shallow, which is normal for the Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone. Typically, they would be within 10 kilometres of the surface.\n\nSo far, there have been several over a magnitude of four and many others of a lesser magnitude, Ristau said.\n\nSeismologists were still puzzling over the differences between the two kinds of earthquakes, but in both cases the stress built up - however, a swarm of quakes occurred because the stress could not be released in one big shake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fault large enough for that one large earthquake to happen. So instead, it triggers earthquakes a little bit smaller on other faults in order to release that stress.\n\n\u201cThese can go on for several days - they can go on for weeks or months, unfortunately, and then taper off over time.\u201d\n\nIt was not necessarily a harbinger of a big earthquake to come, although he was not promising this, he said.\n\nThere would be some people who would recall the series of small earthquakes that preceded the magnitude 6.5 Edgecumbe earthquake on March 2, 1987.\n\nHe expected the possible crack in the side of nearby Mt Putauaki would be investigated further today.\n\nRisk of landslides\n\nGNS said there has been some landslide activity in the area related to these earthquakes, including rockfalls. This extent of landsliding is to be expected for M4-5 earthquakes. The ground is likely more vulnerable to landslides now due to the recent cyclone and rain, and there are many landslides still visible after Cyclone Gabrielle.\n\nLandslides can be triggered by heavy rain or earthquakes and can occur with little or no warning. Some can occur without any obvious trigger. Homes near hills or steep slopes and cliffs are most at-risk - so residents should be on the lookout for cracks or movement that could be a warning sign, and quickly get to safety.\n\nGNS said given the tectonic setting, history of swarm activity, and the normal-faulting mechanisms identified for some of the larger events, it was most likely that this swarm was tectonic in nature.\n\nAlthough it is a geothermal area, it would be very rare for geothermal activity to lead to such large-magnitude earthquakes. The location of the swarm is outside a volcanic area, so there is no indication of volcanic unrest, and no relation to the recent unrest at Taup\u014d or Ruapehu.\n\nGNS teams are continuing to monitor the activity and expected the most likely scenario was for the swarm activity to continue decreasing over the next few days.",

It is expected that the number of displaced people will change as more data becomes available.\n\n\u25cfShelter/NFIs: Government figures stand at 191,800 buildings heavily damaged as of 27 February. An estimated 1.4 \u2013 1.6 million people are in tents, approximately 34,000 people in containers, and 465,000 people in public buildings such as dormitories according to government data. An unknown number of people are in makeshift settlements. IOM has assessed 259 displacement sites across the 11 provinces. In 21% of sites, key informants indicated there was no functioning electricity. In 19% of sites, key informants indicated there were no functioning heaters.\n\n\u25cfWASH: While detailed information from the site assessment is not yet available, yet datapoints show that latrine to people ratios are well below SPHERE standards, or latrines are not available at all. Out of the 259 displacement sites assessed by IOM, 50% lacked showers; of sites where showers were available, 64% were not modified for people with disabilities. There is unsafe access to facilities for women, children and persons with disabilities. High needs of hygiene and dignity kits have been reported, though 40% of key informants in sites indicated these were not available.\n\n\u25cfHealth: Lack of WASH facilities increasing risk of waterborne disease and other outbreaks. High PSS needs continue to be reported. In 259 assessed displacement sites across the 11 provinces, key informants in 25% of sites indicated that there was no health facility nearby. A further 33% noted that basic medicine was unavailable.\n\n\u25cfFood: Ready to eat foods and hot meals continue to be needed. Out of 259 assessed displacement sites across the 11 provinces, key informants in 34% of sites indicated that people purchase their own food. In other sites distributions are available on or off site, though different reports have indicated that queues might be long and food is not always sufficient. In 32% of sites key informants reported insufficient availability of baby foods.",

        "description": "Key figures in north-west Syria\n\n4,500+ Deaths due to earthquakes\n\n8,700+ Injuries due to earthquakes\n\n10,600+ Partially or fully damaged buildings\n\n53,100+ Suspected cholera cases\n\nHighlights\n\n\u2022 More than 4,500 deaths and 8,700 injuries have been reported in north-west Syria, as of 6 March, since an earthquake of 7.7 magnitude struck T\u00fcrkiye on 6 February.\n\n\u2022 Thousands of people became homeless as more than 10,600 buildings have been completely or partially destroyed in north-west Syria.\n\n\u2022 On 20 February, the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) launched the first phase of its Reserve Allocation, valued at $30 million, to address immediate life-saving needs.\n\n\u2022 As of 7 March, a total of 617 trucks loaded with aid provided by seven UN agencies have so far crossed to north-west Syria since the earthquakes.\n\n\u2022 Multi-purpose cash, amounting to $6 million, has been distributed to over 190,000 people in need in north-west Syria as of 6 March.\n\nOne month post-earthquakes\n\nOne month has passed since a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck T\u00fcrkiye and Syria in the early hours of 6 February, followed by almost 14,000 aftershocks. Earthquake survivors are continuing to grapple with the loss of their homes and loved ones in both countries. More than 4,500 deaths and 8,700 injuries have been recorded in north-west Syria alone, compounding what already is a dire humanitarian situation.\n\nFor many Syrians, this March also marks their 12th year of living with conflict and displacement. In 2023, Syria remains the world\u2019s largest internal displacement crisis. Some 1.9 million people live in some 1,430 camps or self-settled sites in the north-west, the majority of whom are women and children. The earthquakes have caused new internal displacement movements and at least 86,000 people were reportedly newly displaced since 6 February. More than half of them are children.\n\nIn search for safety and normalcy\n\nUm Mohammed and her five children are among the earthquake survivors who now live in one of the 77 reception centers in north-west Syria. Their house in Afrin city has fully collapsed, rendering the family homeless and foodless on the streets for two days. She recalled seeing her children turning \u201cblue\u201d from the freezing temperatures in the absence of a shelter. \u201cWe are used to not having food for some days before this disaster. The difference is that we felt safe at home,\u201d shared Um Mohammed.\n\nWhile the living situation in the reception center is \u201cbetter than the streets,\u201d the mental health toll continued to take visible effects on her children. For instance, her 13-year-old daughter has not spoken or taken a shower for ten days due to the shock.\n\nUm Mohammed looked at her daughter and asked: \u201cWhat can I do? There is no solution. All can do is stay with my kids.\u201d Outside of camps and reception centers, glimmers of normalcy can also be seen in pockets of districts. Many schools in Idleb for instance have resumed their classrooms but many teachers and students are still recollecting the moment of the disaster.\n\nMaya is a fourth-grade student at an all-girls school in Harim. She returned to the classroom in the last week of February but noted that \u201cthings are not the same.\u201d \u201cHalf of my friends are gone and some are still in the hospital,\u201d said Maya. She recounted how they used to sit together in the schoolyard to share stories, eat chips and finish their homework together.\n\nUnlike some other schools in Harim, the Hay El-Kherbe school remains mostly physically intact. Khawla Dalil, the school\u2019s principal, noted that some 170 out of 300 students have returned so far but many continue to face anxiety and fears. The school has provided some psychosocial support to students but behind each activity, there is still a sense of \u201csorrow\u201d lingering in the classroom. \"Two teachers and 20 students were victims of the earthquakes,\u201d said Khawla. \u201cThe children go out and play but we still feel the pain in their hearts.\u201d",

Many were crushed or buried as they slept.\n\nThe provisional damage figure, which Vinton said covers only Turkey, is being used as a basis for a donor conference on March 16 in Brussels to raise money for survivors and reconstruction.\n\nThe World Bank previously estimated the direct damage in Turkey at $34.2bn, but it said recovery and reconstruction costs will be much higher and losses to Turkey\u2019s gross domestic product associated with economic disruptions caused by the quakes will also add to the cost.\n\n\u2018Apocalyptic\u2019 scenes\n\nVinton said the Turkish government with support from the UNDP, the World Bank and the European Union had calculated far higher damage.\n\nOnce this estimate is completed, it will become the basis for the recovery and reconstruction donor conference next week, she said.\n\nRecovery costs, including building improved and more environmentally sustainable infrastructure, \u201cwill obviously exceed that amount\u201d, she said.\n\nVinton described the scenes in Turkey\u2019s worst-hit Hatay province as \u201capocalyptic\u201d, saying hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed. \u201cThe needs are vast but the resources are scarce,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout two million survivors have been housed in temporary accommodation or evacuated from the earthquake-devastated region, according to Turkish government figures\n\nAbout 1.5 million people are living in tents while another 46,000 have been moved to container houses.

Building after building, block after block, had been levelled.\n\nRescue teams were working frantically to reach people buried in the rubble of that first magnitude 7.8 earthquake on February 6.\n\nI had been awakened just after 4am that day by Al Jazeera's newsdesk to be told that an earthquake had hit southern Turkey, where my family is from, and still lives.

        "title": "Turkey's earthquake caused $34 billion in damage. It could cost Erdogan the election",
        "description": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here .\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) The devastating earthquake that hit Turkey on February 6 killed at least 45,000 people, rendered millions homeless across almost a dozen cities and caused immediate damage estimated at $34 billion -- or roughly 4% of the country's annual economic output, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut the indirect cost of the quake could be much higher, and recovery will be neither easy nor quick\n\nThe Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation estimates the total cost of the quake at $84.1 billion , the lion's share of which would be for housing, at $70.8 billion, with lost national income pegged at $10.4 billion and lost working days at $2.91 billion.\n\n\"I do not recall... any economic disaster at this level in the history of the Republic of Turkey,\" said Arda Tunca, an Istanbul-based economist at PolitikYol.\n\nTurkey's economy had been slowing even before the earthquake. Unorthodox monetary policies by the government caused soaring inflation, leading to further income inequality and a currency crisis that saw the lira lose 30% of its value against the dollar last year. Turkey's economy grew 5.6% last year, Reuters reported, citing official data.\n\nEconomists say those structural weaknesses in the economy will only get worse because of the quake and could determine the course of presidential and parliamentary elections expected in mid-May\n\nStill, Tunca says that while the physical damage from the quake is colossal, the cost to the country's GDP won't be as pronounced when compared to the 1999 earthquake in Izmit , which hit the country's industrial heartland and killed more than 17,000. According to the OECD, the areas impacted in that quake accounted for a third of the country's GDP\n\nThe provinces most affected by the February 6 quake represent some 15% of Turkey's population. According to the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, they contribute 9% of the nation's GDP, 11% of income tax and 14% of income from agriculture and fisheries.\n\n\"Economic growth would slow down at first but I don't expect a recessionary threat due to the earthquake,\" said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. \"I don't expect the impact on (economic) growth to be more than 1 to 2 (percentage) points.\"\n\nThere has been growing criticism of the country's preparedness for the quake, whether through policies to mitigate the economic impact or prevent the scale of the damage seen in the disaster.\n\nHow Turkey will rehabilitate its economy and provide for its newly homeless people is not yet known. But it could prove pivotal in determining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's political fate, analysts and economists say, as he seeks another term in office.\n\nStrong fiscal position\n\nThe government's 2023 budget, released before the earthquake, had planned for increased spending in an election year, foreseeing a deficit of 660 billion liras ($34.9 billion).\n\nThe government has already announced some measures that analysts said were designed to shore up Erdogan's popularity, including a near 55% increase in the minimum wage, early retirement and cheaper housing loans.\n\nEconomists say that Turkey's fiscal position is strong. Its budget deficit, when compared to its economic output, is smaller than that of other emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. That gives the government room to spend.\n\n\"Turkey starts from a position of relative fiscal strength,\" said Selva Bahar Baziki of Bloomberg Economics. \"The necessary quake spending will likely result in the government breaching their budget targets. Given the high humanitarian toll, this would be the year to do it.\"\n\nQuake-related public spending is estimated at 2.6% of GDP in the short run, she told CNN, but could eventually reach as high as 5.5%.\n\nGovernments usually plug budget shortfalls by taking on more debt or raising taxes. Economists say both are likely options. But post-quake taxation is already a touchy topic in the country, and could prove risky in an election year.\n\nAfter the 1999 quake, Turkey introduced an \"earthquake tax\" that was initially introduced as a temporary measure to help cushion economic damage, but subsequently became a permanent tax.\n\nThere has been concern in the country that the state may have squandered those tax revenues, with opposition leaders calling on the government to be more transparent about what happened to the money raised. When asked in 2020, Erdogan said the money \" was not spent out of its purpose .\" Since then, the government has said little more about how the money was spent.\n\n\"The funds created for earthquake preparedness have been used for projects such as road constructions, infrastructure build-ups, etc. other than earthquake preparedness,\" said Tunca. \"In other words, no buffers or cushions have been set in place to limit the economic impacts of such disasters.\"\n\nThe Turkish presidency didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nAnalysts say it's too early to tell precisely what impact the economic fallout will have on Erdogan's prospects for re-election.\n\nThe president's approval rating was low even before the quake. In a December poll by Turkish research firm MetroPOLL, 52.1% of respondents didn't approve of his handling of his job as president. A survey a month earlier found that a slim majority of voters would not vote for Erdogan if an election were held on that day.\n\nTwo polls last week, however, showed the Turkish opposition had not picked up fresh support , Reuters reported, citing partly its failure to name a candidate and partly its lack of a tangible plan to rebuild areas devastated by the quake.\n\nVoter defection\n\nThe majority of the provinces worst affected by the quake voted for Erdogan and his ruling AK Party in the 2018 elections, but in some of those provinces, Erdogan and the AK Party won with a plurality of votes or a slim majority.\n\nThose provinces are some of the poorest in the country , the World Bank says.\n\nResearch conducted by Demiralp as well as academics Evren Balta from Ozyegin University and Seda Demiralp from Isik University, found that while the ruling AK Party's voters' high partisanship is a strong hindrance to voter defection, economic and democratic failures could tip the balance.\n\n\"Our data shows that respondents who report being able to make ends meet are more likely to vote for the incumbent AKP again,\" the research concludes. \"However, once worsening economic fundamentals push more people below the poverty line, the possibility of defection increases.\"\n\nThis could allow opposition parties to take votes from the incumbent rulers \"despite identity-based cleavages if they target economically and democratically dissatisfied voters via clear messages.\"\n\nFor Tunca, the economic fallout from the quake poses a real risk for Erdogan's prospects.\n\n\"The magnitude of Turkey's social earthquake is much greater than that of the tectonic one,\" he said. \"There is a tug of war between the government and the opposition, and it seems that the winner is going to be unknown until the very end of the elections.\"\n\nNadeen Ebrahim and Isil Sariyuce contributed to this report.\n\nThis article has been corrected to say that the research, not the survey, was conducted by the academics.\n\nThe digest\n\nSub-Saharan African countries repatriate citizens from Tunisia after 'shocking' statements from country's president\n\nSub-Saharan African countries including Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Gabon, are helping their citizens return from Tunisia following a controversial statement from Tunisian President Kais Saied, who has led a crackdown on illegal immigration into the North African country since last month.\n\nBackground: In a meeting with Tunisia's National Security Council on February 21, Saied described illegal border crossing from sub-Saharan Africa into Tunisia as a \"criminal enterprise hatched at the beginning of this century to change the demographic composition of Tunisia.\" He said the immigration aims to turn Tunisia into \"only an African country with no belonging to the Arab and Muslim worlds.\" In a later speech on February 23, Saied maintained there is no racial discrimination in Tunisia and said that Africans residing in Tunisia legally are welcome. Authorities arrested 58 African migrants on Friday after they reportedly crossed the border illegally, state news agency TAP reported on Saturday.\n\nWhy it matters: Saied, whose seizure of power in 2021 was described as a coup by his foes, is facing challenges to his rule at home. Reuters on Sunday reported that opposition figures and rights groups have said that the president's crackdown on migrants was meant to distract from Tunisia's economic crisis.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader says schoolgirls' poisoning is an 'unforgivable crime'\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday said that the poisoning of schoolgirls in recent months across Iran is an \"unforgivable crime,\" state-run news agency IRNA reported. Khamenei urged authorities to pursue the issue, saying that \"if it is proven that the students were poisoned, the perpetrators of this crime should be severely punished.\"\n\nBackground: Concern is growing in Iran after reports emerged that hundreds of schoolgirls had been poisoned across the country over the last few months. On Wednesday, Iran's semi-official Mehr News reported that Shahriar Heydari, a member of parliament, said that \"nearly 900 students\" from across the country had been poisoned so far, citing an unnamed, \"reliable source.\"\n\nWhy it matters: The reports have led to a local and international outcry. While it is unclear whether the incidents were linked and if the students were targeted, some believe them to be deliberate attempts at shutting down girls' schools, and even potentially linked to recent protests that spread under the slogan, \"Women, Life, Freedom.\"\n\nIran to allow further IAEA access following discussions -- IAEA chief\n\nIran will allow more access and monitoring capabilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), agency Director General Rafael Grossi said at a press conference in Vienna on Saturday, following a trip to the Islamic Republic. The additional monitoring is set to start \"very, very soon,\" said Grossi, with an IAEA team arriving within a few days to begin reinstalling the equipment at several sites.\n\nBackground: Prior to the news conference, the IAEA released a joint statement with Iran's atomic energy agency in which the two bodies agreed that interactions between them will be \"carried out in the spirit of collaboration.\" Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said he hopes the IAEA will remain neutral and fair to Iran's nuclear energy program and refrain from being affected \"by certain powers which are pursuing their own specific goals,\" reported Iranian state television Press TV on Saturday.\n\nWhy it matters: Last week, a restricted IAEA report seen by CNN said that uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels have been found at an Iranian nuclear facility, as the US warned that Tehran's ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. The president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Mohammad Eslami, rejected the recent IAEA report, which detected particles of uranium enriched to 83.7% at the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran, saying there has been '\"no deviation\" in Iran's peaceful nuclear activities.\n\nAround the region\n\nA new sphinx statue has been discovered in Egypt -- but this one is thought to be Roman.\n\nThe smiling sculpture and the remains of a shrine were found during an excavation mission in Qena, a southern Egyptian city on the eastern banks of the River Nile.\n\nThe shrine had been carved in limestone and consisted of a two-level platform, Mamdouh Eldamaty, a former minister of antiquities and professor of Egyptology at Ain Shams University said in a statement Monday from Egypt's ministry of tourism and antiquities . A ladder and mudbrick basin for water storage were found inside.\n\nThe basin, believed to date back to the Byzantine era, housed the smiling sphinx statue, carved from limestone.\n\nEldamaty described the statue as bearing \"royal facial features.\" It had a \"soft smile\" with two dimples. It also wore a nemes on its head, the striped cloth headdress traditionally worn by pharaohs of ancient Egypt, with a cobra-shaped end or \"uraeus.\"\n\nA Roman stela with hieroglyphic and demotic writings from the Roman era was found below the sphinx.\n\nThe professor said that the statue may represent the Roman Emperor Claudius , the fourth Roman emperor who ruled from the year 41 to 54, but noted that more studies are needed to verify the structure's owner and history.\n\nThe discovery was made in the eastern side of Dendera Temple in Qena, where excavations are still ongoing.\n\nSphinxes are recurring creatures in the mythologies of ancient Egyptian, Persian and Greek cultures. Their likenesses are often found near tombs or religious buildings.\n\nIt is not uncommon for new sphinx statues to be found in Egypt . But the country's most famous sphinx, the Great Sphinx of Giza, dates back to around 2,500 BC and represents the ancient Egyptian Pharoah Khafre.\n\nBy Nadeen Ebrahim\n\nPhoto of the day",

        "title": "How to Engineer Buildings That Withstand Earthquakes",
        "description": "Our planet is covered by tectonic plates that are slowly moving around, pushing into or sliding past one another along boundaries called faults. Friction sometimes causes two of these plates to get stuck to each other at spots along a fault. Tension builds up over years, decades or even centuries until suddenly the fault snaps. The two sides lurch past each other, unleashing an earthquake.\n\nFrom the place where the fault ruptures, seismic waves ripple outward in all directions. When they reach Earth\u2019s surface, they can set buildings or any other structures shaking\u2014violently and destructively if the quake is strong and close enough, as were the two massive temblors that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, which was followed by a large aftershock on the same day.\n\nThese quakes killed more than 45,000 people, many of them in collapsed buildings. Though earthquakes can\u2019t be prevented or predicted, science does have some ways to protect buildings\u2014and the people inside them. Scientific American spoke with several earthquake engineering experts to learn more about how using the right building methods can prevent homes, offices and other structures from succumbing to the capricious movements of the Earth.\n\nWhat happens to a building during a quake?\n\nImagine you\u2019re driving a car down the road, and you suddenly need to stop. As you slam on the brakes, those groceries sitting on the passenger seat (and anything else not strapped down) will fly through the air in the same direction and at the same speed as the car was originally going. This is because of inertia\u2014an object\u2019s tendency to stay at rest or to maintain a uniform speed and path until some other force acts on it. That same tendency is what puts a building at risk during an earthquake.\n\nDuring a quake, the ground beneath a building moves quickly back and forth. But because the building has mass, it has inertia. \u201cThe earthquake is shaking the ground, and the building is trying to stay put,\u201d says Ertugrul Taciroglu, a structural engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles. But once it does start moving, the building wants to keep going in whatever direction the earthquake has pulled it\u2014essentially, it is always lagging behind the ground motion. These lags generate horizontal inertial forces on the building, causing any vertical columns and walls to deform at an angle (creating a parallelogram shape if one were looking at a side view of a rectangular building). When a building has multiple stories, each story is holding up the weight of those above it. That means lower stories have to bear larger inertial forces than those above. If walls and columns are not properly designed or reinforced, they may not be able to support the weight they once held.\n\nThe larger an earthquake is and the closer it is to the surface \u2014and the nearer a building is to the fault rupture\u2014the larger the inertial forces will be on that building during a quake. The type of ground a building is sitting on can also play a role: compared with hard rock, looser soils magnify ground motions.\n\nHow do we build buildings so they don\u2019t collapse during an earthquake?\n\nTo keep a building intact when an earthquake hits, it needs to be constructed to resist horizontal inertial forces. Exactly how that can be done depends on the building material being used. Let\u2019s focus on two of the most common: concrete and steel. Much of the building stock in the affected area of Turkey used these materials.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, concrete is a great material for holding the weight of a building because it performs well under what engineers call compression. A concrete building can easily last for decades if it only has to support its own weight. Yet the quake-generated inertial forces that set vertical walls and columns swaying put the concrete into tension, the opposite of compression. Although the forces are trying to stretch the concrete out, \u201cit doesn\u2019t give. It doesn\u2019t let the building form move but tries to hold on really tight, and it generates these inertial large forces,\u201d says Perry Adebar, a structural engineer at the University of British Columbia. The stressed concrete columns and walls can eventually crack and fail because they can no longer support the weight above them.\n\nConcrete is still one of the most widely used building materials in the world, in part because it is cheap and abundant and because it has an ability to bear structural weight. To make concrete more suitable for seismically active areas, engineers add steel (in the form of rebar), which is much more flexible. \u201cYou have to put steel in wherever you're going to have tension,\u201d Adebar says.\n\nSteel behaves elastically when subjected to a certain amount of tension. Think of tugging gently on the bottom of a wire coat hanger and seeing it bounce back into shape when you let go. But when subjected to larger amounts of tension, such as in a very strong quake, steel \u201cbecomes plastic and deformed,\u201d Adebar explains. Think of pulling hard enough on the bottom of the coat hanger that it bends out of shape. In the case of a building during an earthquake, \u201cthat\u2019s just exactly what you want,\u201d Adebar says, because the deformed steel has effectively absorbed those inertial forces but can still hold up weight.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that mean the building is damaged?\n\nIn a large earthquake, yes. Steel-reinforced concrete buildings can still sustain considerable damage, possibly to the point that they will be unusable after the quake. This has to do with the way governments set building codes, which tell engineers how to design a building to withstand a certain level of earthquake shaking. Codes, including those in the U.S. and Turkey, generally require that a building achieves what is called \u201clife safety\u201d under a given maximum expected earthquake in an area. \u201cOur seismic codes are only a minimum requirement,\u201d says Sissy Nikolaou, research earthquake engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cYou just want these buildings at least to give you the chance to get out of it alive when the big one happens, under the assumption that they may be seriously damaged.\u201d The situation is akin to a car that crumples in a crash: the vehicle absorbs the impact to protect passengers, but it is totaled.\n\nThere are, of course, different standards for buildings or other infrastructure that are considered critical and that need to keep functioning after a quake\u2014for example, hospitals. Experts such as Nikolaou are also beginning to rethink the life-safety standard so that more structures are usable after an earthquake. Doing so could avoid situations where people are kept out of their homes for months or years. Many people in Turkey now face this possibility, with tens of thousands of buildings deemed at risk of collapse from damage sustained in the February 6 quakes.\n\nThere are ways to keep buildings habitable after an earthquake. Some methods involve smarter designs with common materials such as steel-reinforced concrete. It can also require more technological approaches, such as \u201cbase isolation.\u201d With this technique, a building is not rigidly attached to its foundation. Instead it sits atop flexible structures that decouple it from the foundation\u2014and therefore from shaking ground. This type of system adds to construction costs, though, and some building owners would be unable or unwilling to pay for it. In the U.S., it has been used to protect crucial structures such as hospitals and to retrofit historic buildings while preserving their original architecture. Some hospitals in Turkey had base-isolation systems and withstood the recent quakes there.\n\nWhy might a building fail even if it is built to earthquake codes?\n\nBuildings are designed to withstand a certain level of shaking, based on the seismic risks in their location. A building in Los Angeles, for example, would be built to withstand a larger earthquake than one in New York City. But seismologists don\u2019t always know exactly how big of an earthquake a fault can produce. \u201cThe major difficulty in engineering design is the uncertainty about the future earthquakes, because we don\u2019t know what will happen precisely,\u201d Taciroglu says. The bigger the magnitude, the rarer the quake. Some of the biggest may only happen every few hundred or thousand years\u2014but modern seismic measurements only go back a few decades. Many seismologists thought the East Anatolian Fault\u2014the one involved in the Turkey-Syria quakes\u2014was likely to produce a maximum magnitude of 7.4 or 7.5. But the February 6 earthquake was a 7.8\u2014about four times bigger on the logarithmic scale of earthquake magnitudes. So it is possible that some structures built to code in Turkey may simply have experienced more force than they were built to withstand, Taciroglu says.\n\nBuilding codes also evolve as science\u2019s understanding of earthquake risk and engineering change, so a building that was been built to code at the time it was constructed might not meet updated standards. Retrofitting such buildings is often cost-prohibitive. Taciroglu says this is likely the reason many of the buildings in Turkey were severely damaged or collapsed.\n\nHuman error can also come into play. It may range from intentional, profit-driven cuttings of corners to honest mistakes that can happen at various points in the design or building process\u2014and that aren\u2019t revealed unless something like a massive earthquake comes along.",

It will also focus funds on the reconstruction of the railway network to re-establish connectivity between the south-eastern region and the rest of the country.\n\nThe Bank will expand its strong private-sector partnerships and work with companies in various sectors to enable them to continue operating and withstand disruptions to local value chains. It will also help the private sector to adopt new technologies and green principles in planned rebuilding projects.\n\nA key focus of the response package will be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the region. The Bank will provide funding, advisory services and mentorship with a view to repairing damage, building resilience and rebuilding supply chains for businesses in the affected cities.\n\nArvid Tuerkner, EBRD Managing Director for T\u00fcrkiye, said: \u201cThis is one of the most devastating crises seen in T\u00fcrkiye and Europe, for that matter, in over a century and the impact on the population and the economy is extremely severe. The EBRD is ready to support T\u00fcrkiye and its private sector in its recovery and reconstruction efforts by building on its strong track record and existing relationships in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EBRD\u2019s response of up to \u20ac1.5 billion is substantial and reflects the Bank\u2019s commitment to T\u00fcrkiye, particularly in these painful and challenging times,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe will work with the authorities and our partners across sectors to rebuild and reintegrate the region\u2019s economy, while strengthening its green credentials, resilience and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThe EBRD\u2019s response will require additional donor funds and cooperation to support human capital and skills policies, SME advisory, infrastructure project preparation and implementation.\n\nOn 6 February 2023, a series of violent earthquakes struck southern and central T\u00fcrkiye and northern and western Syria, resulting in widespread damage and more than 50,000 fatalities across the region.\n\nThe destruction and loss of human life are unmatched in the country\u2019s history. According to World Bank estimates, direct physical damage to the region totals around US$ 34 billion, while the cost of reconstruction could be twice that, requiring significant spending on the government side.\n\nThe EBRD is the leading institutional investor in T\u00fcrkiye, having invested almost \u20ac17 billion in the country since 2009, 93 per cent of that in the private sector. In 2022 alone, the Bank invested more than \u20ac1.6 billion in the country.",

        "title": "After earthquakes, Syrians utilise new rules to cross from Turkey",
        "description": "Thousands of Syrians have decided to rely on support networks in their home country after earthquakes devastated their homes in Turkey.\n\nBab al-Hawa, Syria \u2013 After seven years apart, Hussein al-Ahmed made the journey from Turkey, and finally reunited with his family in northern Syria.\n\nBut it was not any change related to the war in Syria that brought him back.\n\nInstead, al-Ahmed is one of the thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey who have taken advantage of a relaxation in regulations following the devastating earthquakes that hit southeastern Turkey and northern Syria a month ago.\n\nTurkish authorities now allow Syrian refugees residing in earthquake-hit provinces to voluntarily return to opposition-controlled northwestern Syria and then come back \u2013 as long as they do not spend longer than six months away.\n\nFor Syrians living in the 10 Turkish provinces most deeply affected by the earthquakes, where so many buildings have been destroyed and many remain unsafe, Syria \u2013 a country they fled due to the now 12-year war \u2013 suddenly looks more appealing, albeit temporarily.\n\n\u201cAfter my sister and I spent 10 days in public parks, I did not have any choice other than return to Syria through the voluntary return system that was announced,\u201d said al-Ahmed, a 30-year-old refugee originally from northern rural Hama who lives in the city of Iskenderun in southern Turkey.\n\nThe desperate condition of the southern Turkish provinces hit by the earthquakes, and the lack of relatives in other provinces, are among the pull factors that have encouraged some Syrians to make the journey to northern Syria. There, they have relatives and may be able to at least secure a shelter before again considering whether to stay or to return to Turkey, once earthquake-hit areas have been rebuilt.\n\nThe number of Syrian refugees who arrived in Syria via the Bab al-Hawa, Bab al-Salam, and Jarablus border crossings has reached almost 40,000.\n\n\u201cThe number of refugees arriving through the Bab al-Hawa crossing is nearly 15,000,\u201d Mazen Alloush, director of media relations on the Syrian side of the crossing between the country and Turkey, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAlloush said that the return programme extends only to holders of the temporary protection permit, and is not open to holders of tourist residency permits, or even dual Syrian-Turkish citizens.\n\nA Turkish defence ministry official also told Reuters last week that 40,000 Syrians had returned to their home country.\n\nSince April last year, Syrians had been prevented from making round trips back to Syria, and were not allowed to return to Turkey if they crossed the border.\n\nThe issue of Syrian refugees in Turkey, who number more than 3.75 million, has been a controversial one in recent years, with rising anti-Syrian sentiment among the Turkish public.\n\nOpportunity to get away\n\nFor al-Ahmed, his planned three-month trip to Syria provides an opportunity to get away from what he experienced during the earthquakes, which killed more than 50,000 people in both Turkey and Syria, but he will then need to return.\n\n\u201cI will go back to Turkey after my trip ends because my family lives in a refugee camp here and I do not want to increase their burden,\u201d al-Ahmed said. \u201cI also have to resume work so I can secure a living for me and my family here.\u201d\n\nFor others, the opportunity to return home allowed them to finally say goodbye to family members that had passed in their absence.\n\nMalak Khazna, a Syrian refugee who has lived in the Turkish city of Antakya for the past nine years, lost her mother two years ago, but had been unable to return for fear of being stuck in Syria.\n\n\u201cMy number one reason for returning is visiting my mother\u2019s grave. Perhaps she would forgive me for when I couldn\u2019t say goodbye and take care of her during her illness,\u2019 Khazna told Al Jazeera.\n\nKhazna said that the destruction caused by the earthquake had reminded her of her experiences during the war in Syria, where buildings were toppled and civilians were stuck under the rubble.\n\n\u201cMy stay is for three months. I will live with my son and his family,\u201d said Khazna. \u201cIf I find things to be stable, and there are no air strikes, I will remain here and won\u2019t return to Turkey. I went to Turkey to flee the [Syrian President Bashar] al-Assad regime\u2019s air strikes \u2013 I didn\u2019t go there to settle.\u201d\n\nThe quake-stricken, southern Turkish provinces host the highest numbers of Syrian refugees in Turkey, in light of their proximity to the Syrian borders, and their low rent and cost of living in comparison to the other provinces.\n\nSome of the refugees who resided in these provinces have now decided to make a permanent return after the earthquake, in which many lost their jobs and their belongings.\n\nHassan Hasram, a father to eight children, is a Syrian refugee who lived in Antakya.\n\nNow, after losing his grandson and son-in-law in the earthquake, he has decided to go back to Syria.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t move to another province because of rent skyrocketing after the earthquake in most Turkish provinces. Also, my family is big and I won\u2019t be able to afford our expenses after losing my workplace,\u201d said Hasram.\n\nHasram told Al Jazeera that he has no relatives besides his sister, who lives in a refugee camp near the Syrian-Turkish border, and her tent would not be enough to shelter him and his family.\n\nAnd so, between the option of the tent he currently lives in, and making the risky journey back to Syria, he has decided to go home.\n\n\u201cThings are very bad in the camp [in Turkey]. There is a serious shortage of aid, whether in terms of food, or heating, or even drinking water,\u201d Hasram said. \u201cTurkey is now part of the past, and I won\u2019t be able to go back again.\u201d",

        "title": "This CNN Hero traveled 5,500 miles to deliver care to Turkey's earthquake survivors",
        "description": "(CNN) At home in Anchorage, Alaska, nurse Teresa Gray was playing a board game with her children when she heard about the massive earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria on February 6.\n\nAlthough she was more than 5,500 miles away from the disaster, she immediately sprang into action.\n\nGray's nonprofit, Mobile Medics International , sends small teams of volunteer medics to humanitarian crises around the world. They are typically on the ground to help within the first few days.\n\nSince 2017, Gray and her group have responded to dozens of disasters, providing free medical care and comfort to more than 30,000 people on five continents. Last year, she was honored as a Top 10 CNN Hero for her work.\n\nBy February 7, Gray had received permission from Turkey's Ministry of Health to join the relief efforts, and she flew out early the next morning.\n\n\"It's pretty frantic leading up to a mission,\" Gray told CNN as she made final preparations to travel. \"We like to get in as soon as possible. So, we'll be on the ground about 72 hours post-earthquake.\"\n\nShe packed up supplies to help hundreds of patients, ranging from trauma dressings to antibiotics to acetaminophen. She also prepared the equipment her team would need to be self-sustaining in freezing winter conditions.\n\n\"The buildings have been substantially damaged, so you can't stay inside, it's too dangerous,\" she said. \"We're going to be sleeping in a tent, eating MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) ... This is not going to be a good time.\"\n\nGray also did a video call to touch base with her team, which included a paramedic from London, a doctor from Malaysia, and a nurse anesthetist from Missouri. It was a hectic time for Gray, who says she gets \"hyper-focused\" before each mission, trying to anticipate problems that might arise.\n\n\"We need to find a safe place to be. What if somebody forgot their sleeping bag? We don't speak the language, so I need to find some interpreters,\" she said. \"These are the things that run through my mind as I'm getting ready to go to the airport.\"\n\nAfter an epic journey through Seattle and New York, Gray finally landed in Turkey late on February 9 and met up with her team. They made their way to Hatay Province and once there, began doing mobile clinics on the streets of Samandag.\n\nFor Gray, the destruction she saw was difficult to comprehend.\n\n\"Just the total amount of annihilation ... this is probably the most devastation that I have ever seen on any mission that we've been on,\" she said.\n\nSince so many structures were unstable, the government had mandated that all families must sleep outside in tents. In a cell phone video made on Valentine's Day, Gray described how she and her group would go street to street, stopping at tents to offer their help. She reported treating people for earthquake injuries, including a girl who had been trapped in the rubble for more than 12 hours, as well as sicknesses like the flu that had been exacerbated by the living conditions.\n\n\"Whatever they need us to look at, we will,\" she said. \"Then we go back, sleep in our car. Get up the next morning and do it again.\"\n\nThey treated hundreds of people during their 10-day mission, Gray said. One of their interpreters, a high school teacher who they called K.T., became an essential part of their team. In a cell phone video, K.T. told Gray what the people they were helping had said to her.\n\n\"They told me, 'Say them (sic) thank you. It's really good for us because ... we can't see any doctor, we can't go any hospital,\" K.T. said.\n\nK.T. had also suffered a great deal. Two of her students had been killed in the earthquake, and the school where she taught had been destroyed. She and most of her extended family -- a total of 15 people -- lost their homes and were forced to take refuge in a greenhouse on their property.\n\nDespite their own hardship, K.T.'s family adopted Gray's group as their own, Gray said -- letting them stay on their property, making them tea and coffee, and sharing meals with them. Their generosity served as another reminder that, even in desperate times, humanity shines through.\n\nOn February 19, Gray got back to Alaska. When a 6.3 magnitude aftershock hit Turkey the next day, she immediately reached out to K.T. and others she befriended on her journey to make sure they were all okay. She's working to send another team of volunteers very soon.",

        "title": "Istanbul warned to get ready for doomsday earthquake",
        "description": "The death toll in Turkey from last month\u2019s devastating earthquake has risen to 45,089, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said on Wednesday (1 March), while geologists warned that another major quake may strike Turkey\u2019s industrial northwest.\n\nThe earthquake and subsequent powerful tremors injured more than 108,000 in Turkey and left millions sheltering in tents or seeking to move to other cities. Together with the victims in Syria, the death toll has reached about 51,000.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has pledged to rebuild homes within a year but it will be many months before thousands can leave tents or container housing, and daily queues for food, and move into permanent housing.\n\nEarthquakes in southeastern Turkey have prompted authorities to look again at how the quake-prone nation might cope with a similar tremor in Turkey\u2019s densely populated, northwestern industrial heartland.\n\nAttention turns to Istanbul\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\u2019s biggest city with a population of 16 million and the country\u2019s commercial engine, lies near fault lines that criss-cross the country. Two earthquakes three months apart killed nearly 20,000 in the northwest in 1999. Geologists say another could strike.\n\nThe 6 February earthquake has caused about $34 billion in direct physical damage, the World Bank estimated on Monday, but total reconstruction and recovery costs could be twice as high. The southeast region has a sizeable manufacturing sector, albeit smaller than Turkey\u2019s northwest.\n\nA tremor on the scale of February\u2019s quake in Istanbul, one of the world\u2019s mega cities that lies on the strategic Bosphorus waterway, could wreak havoc and so require more preparation.\n\n\u201cThis is (Turkey\u2019s) industrial centre. Destruction of that magnitude here could have much graver consequences that could lead to the country\u2019s destruction,\u201d said Bugra Gokce, deputy secretary-general of the opposition-run Istanbul municipality.\n\n\u201cThe state should view this as a national security problem and should prioritise and allocate resources here,\u201d said Bugra, responsible for the municipality\u2019s earthquake risk management.\n\nThis month\u2019s earthquakes and the issue of preparedness for a major one in the northwestern Marmara region around Istanbul are set to be key issues in presidential and parliamentary elections which Turkey is scheduled to hold by June.\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s two decade rule has been defined by a construction boom. He is now expected to face his biggest ever political challenge in those votes and has pledged a swift campaign to rebuild tens of thousands of homes after more than 180,000 buildings were destroyed in the latest quakes.\n\nThe Brief \u2014 Erdogan between two earthquakes The 6 February earthquake is a massive tragedy for Turkey and Syria, and the world needs to do much more to alleviate the suffering of millions of people. This Brief, however, will look into the seism\u2019s consequences for the future of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nThe Marmara region is home to 25 million people and accounts for just over 40 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2021, according to figures from Turkey\u2019s Statistics Institute.\n\nRapid urbanisation\n\nIt hosts many factories producing goods such as cement, textiles, automotive items and oil. It is a transit channel for international trade with numerous commercial and passenger ports and the Istanbul straits linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\nTurkey sits across several active fault lines, leaving it prone to large earthquakes. A branch of the North Anatolia faultline runs though the Marmara Sea, south of Istanbul.\n\nExperts say attention needs to be focused once again on Istanbul\u2019s readiness for a major quake, something that has been a matter of public debate periodically since the 1999 disaster.\n\n\u201c(Building) Standards could have improved over the past 25 years if steps had been taken systematically, but\u2026that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Bugra said, warning that preparation for an earthquake in or near Istanbul was not a task for a single governmental entity and required a nation-wide effort.\n\n\u201cWe need a mobilisation by all the state institutions\u2026.and have to transform policies and do this within the next 5-6 years,\u201d Bugra said.\n\nSince 1999, Istanbul has undergone a rapid wave of urbanisation, much of it under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule. In 2018, the government introduced a so-called zoning amnesty across Turkey to legalise unregistered construction work, which engineers and architects warned could endanger lives.\n\nThe government denies criticism that it has been systematically lax on safety standards, but last week Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag acknowledged Turkey should no longer implement the amnesty and should review penalties on sub standard construction.\n\nBugra\u2019s municipality is run by mayor Ekrem Imamo\u011flu from the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), who has clashed with Erdo\u011fan in the past and who is seen as a potential challenger to him in the presidential election.\n\nHe is set to announce a \u201cmobilisation plan\u201d for Istanbul on Wednesday.\n\nPreparations for an earthquake hitting Istanbul should not be limited to evaluating and strengthening the buildings but also should expand to infrastructure work to secure the flow of energy and water, Bugra said.\n\nSince the quake in the southeast, Istanbul municipality has received more than 100,000 applications for building resilience assessments, triggering the web site to crash, he said.",

        "description": "With hundreds of cases, doctors say medical facilities in NW Syria are lacking and unable to deal with the complications of crush injuries.\n\nIdlib, Syria \u2013 When two-year-old Nour Abdelqader was pulled out from under the rubble in the rebel-held town of Jandaris after last month\u2019s deadly earthquakes, rescue teams thought she was dead.\n\nNour\u2019s brother and mother did not survive the tremors, yet the young toddler\u2019s heart was still beating when she arrived at a hospital in Afrin, northwest Syria.\n\nBut like many survivors of the magnitude 7.8 quake that killed more than 50,000 people across Turkey and Syria on February 6, Nour is suffering from what doctors call crush syndrome, after her limbs were squashed under the heavy weight of the rubble for a prolonged period.\n\nThe little girl lost her right leg because complications from the crush injuries were severe enough to kill her otherwise, and doctors are now trying to provide the necessary treatment and support to help her re-learn how to walk.\n\n\u201cBoth of Nour\u2019s legs were severely damaged during the quake. We had to amputate one leg because the crush injuries were too extensive \u2013 the limb was dead and infected,\u201d said Abdelsalam al-Naasan, an orthopaedic surgeon at Akrabat Hospital, a facility located along the Syria-Turkey border in the rebel-held town of Idlib, and funded by the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM).\n\nNour will need a prosthetic right leg and still needs complex surgeries and specialist procedures to regain functionality in her left leg, explained al-Naasan, adding that optimal care was not available in northwest Syria.\n\n\u201cWhat we can offer here [in Syria] might leave her with long-term disabilities or deformities,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough Nour\u2019s aunt, Fransa al-Manadi, understands that her niece\u2019s recovery will be long and arduous, she hopes to see her walk again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that she\u2019s still alive, even if with one leg,\u201d she said. \u201cI know her treatment will be difficult, but I hope she\u2019ll live as normal a life as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to healthcare officials in northwest Syria, hundreds of the 12,000 people injured in the quakes have been diagnosed with crush syndrome, although the exact number is unknown.\n\nNearly 6,000 people were killed in northwest Syria during the quakes and their aftermath.\n\nOthers were luckier\n\nWhile Nour\u2019s condition is complicated, Barakat Maajoum, 65, who also suffered from crush syndrome during the earthquakes, had better luck.\n\n\u201cWhen our building collapsed during the quakes, the weight of the rubble damaged the vessels in my arm and crushed my muscles,\u201d said the father of three from Jandaris.\n\n\u201cBut I was taken to a hospital in Bab al-Hawa and operated on right away. I was the only one injured from among my family and I\u2019m very lucky that I still have my arm,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to al-Naasan, the first six to nine hours after a crush injury are critical to saving the affected limbs.\n\n\u201cAfter 24 or 36 hours, the chances of saving a limb becomes less likely,\u201d he said, adding that a fasciotomy \u2013 cutting open the inflexible fascia constraining the muscles to allow swelling to expand \u2013 is sometimes needed to revive blood flow that the muscles need to survive.\n\nMaajoum will be staying in the hospital in Akrabat for a while longer, but doctors expect him to make a full recovery and eventually return to work as an imam in his local mosque.\n\nMany cases, few resources\n\nCrush syndrome occurs when limbs are starved of blood circulation for long periods of time, causing muscle fibres to die and toxins to be released into the bloodstream. The syndrome can result in limb amputations, kidney failure, multisystem organ injury and other fatal complications.\n\nAt least 100 of the quake survivors who suffered crush syndrome have been diagnosed with kidney failure, said officials.\n\n\u201cCrush syndrome is particularly dangerous because myoglobin and potassium [toxic materials] released into the bloodstream can cause kidney injury and failure,\u201d said al-Naasan, explaining that at least 300 people have been diagnosed with crush syndrome at Akrabat Hospital alone.\n\nIn addition to needing kidney dialysis, many patients with crush syndrome need specialist care and complex procedures to treat the injuries to damaged organs, and rehabilitation to help them regain the use and functionality of their limbs. \u201cMany might have full or partial disability depending on the level of damage to their limbs,\u201d said al-Naasan.\n\nSpecialist care\n\nAlthough healthcare professionals have been working around the clock to treat victims of the quakes, a lack of resources at facilities in northwest Syria means many patients cannot get the care they need.\n\nAccording to Zuhair al-Qarrat, a general surgeon in Idlib, one of the main challenges facing hospitals in northwest Syria since the quakes is the lack of medical equipment to deal with the complex conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is a high mortality rate among patients diagnosed with crush syndrome. Many of them need specialist treatment and dialysis to treat the kidney failure, but we don\u2019t have enough machines or medical resources for all the patients suffering from the condition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare system in northwest Syria has been lacking resources, medicines, and equipment for the past 10 years. The aid that came through after the quakes only covers 25 percent of our needs,\u201d added al-Qarrat.\n\nAl-Naasan explained that patients with crush syndrome will not only need physical therapy but also mental health support to help them overcome the trauma of their experiences.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of need and not enough to go around,\u201d said al-Naasan. \u201cBut we are doing all we can to help.\u201d",

The tragic earthquake of 6 February 2023 further increases the suffering of the Syrian population.\n\nThe EU and its member states are leading donors of humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in Syria. Since 2011, the total amount of humanitarian funding from the European Union and its member states for the Syria crisis (Syria plus neighbouring countries) is \u20ac27.4 billion. Since the devastating earthquakes, the EU and its member states have already provided \u20ac5.5 million to address the most urgent needs, in additional humanitarian aid to all affected areas.\n\nIn view of the gravity of the humanitarian crisis in Syria exacerbated by the earthquake, the Council decided today to adopt an additional humanitarian amendment to further facilitate the speedy delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe amendment applies for a period of six months.\n\nWith this amendment, the EU has waived the need for humanitarian organisations to seek prior permission from EU member states national competent authorities to make transfers or provide goods and services intended for humanitarian purposes to listed persons and entities.\n\nBackground\n\nIn its conclusions of 9 February 2023, the European Council extended its deepest condolences to the victims of the tragic earthquake of 6 February 2023 and expressed its solidarity with the people of T\u00fcrkiye and Syria. The EU reaffirmed its readiness to provide further assistance to alleviate the suffering in all affected regions. It called on all to ensure humanitarian access to the victims of the earthquake in Syria irrespective of where they are and called the humanitarian community, under the auspices of the United Nations, to ensure the speedy delivery of aid.\n\nOn the day of the earthquake, the EU activated the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) to coordinate EU support measures in response to the earthquake, while on 8 and 9 February 2023 respectively, the Syrian authorities and the World Food Programme in Syria requested to activate the EU civil protection mechanism.\n\nTen EU countries have already offered tents, sleeping bags, mattresses, beds, food items and winter clothing. In addition, the EU has so far provided \u20ac3.5 million in humanitarian assistance to cover the most urgent needs, such as cash for shelter and non-food items, water and sanitation, health, and search and rescue.\n\nThe EU\u2019s sanctions regime was introduced in 2011 in response to the violent repression of the Syrian population by the Syrian regime and those linked to it and includes 291 persons targeted by both an assets freeze and a travel ban, and 70 entities subject to an assets freeze.",
        "summary": "EU sanctions in place regarding Syria target the Assad regime and its supporters, as well as sectors of the economy from which the regime was making profit.\nThe sanctions regime does not prohibit the export of food, medicines or medical equipment by the EU to Syria, and does not target Syria\u2019s healthcare system.\nThe sanctions regime includes a wide-ranging humanitarian exception to ensure the continued provision of humanitarian assistance to any part of the country.\nThe EU and its member states are leading donors of humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in Syria.\nSince 2011, the total amount of humanitarian funding from the European Union and its member states for the Syria crisis (Syria plus neighbouring countries) is \u20ac27.4 billion.",

        "description": "Event\n\nA magnitude-5.0 earthquake occurred in Kahramanmaras Province at around 05:53 March 3. The epicenter was about 30 km (19 miles) southeast of Goksun. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), and light shaking was probably felt throughout parts of east-central and southern Turkey and far northwestern Syria. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. The tremor was likely an aftershock of the major magnitude-7.8 earthquake that occurred in the region Feb. 6. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Light-to-moderate aftershocks are likely over the coming days.\n\nOfficials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter.\n\nAdvice\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, consider vacating multistory buildings where shaking occurred until authorities confirm their structural integrity.

(AP Photo/Emrah Gurel)\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 The death toll from the massive earthquake that hit parts of Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6 continues to rise as more bodies are retrieved from the rubble of demolished buildings. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck the already battered province of Hatay this week damaged or demolished more buildings, compounding the devastation.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the key developments Thursday from the aftermath of the earthquake.\n\nDEATH TOLL TOPS 47,000\n\nTurkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has raised the number of fatalities in Turkey from the magnitude 7.8 earthquake to 43,556.\n\nThe combined death toll in Turkey and Syria now stands at 47,244.\n\nIn an interview with state broadcaster TRT late on Wednesday, Soylu said teams were sifting through two buildings in hard-hit Hatay province in search of further bodies. Search operations elsewhere have come to an end, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 164,000 buildings have either collapsed or are so damaged that they need to be demolished, said Murat Kurum, Turkey\u2019s minister for the environment and urbanization.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSYRIANS SHELTER IN TENTS AND CARS\n\nThe local civil defense in northwestern Syria, known locally as The White Helmets, said Thursday that thousands of children and tens of thousands of families have taken shelter in cars and tents \u201cfearing they would face a repeat of the earthquake.\u201d\n\nIn government-held Syria, a first plane from Bahrain loaded with aid landed in Damascus.

The range in magnitudes (4.7-5.5) is curious, especially given a moment tensor solution gives the Mw at the lower end of the range.

        "description": "In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the east coast of Japan, shifted the Earth's axis, and shortened days on Earth.\n\nThe quake \u2013 the most powerful on record to hit the country \u2013 shifted the planet's axis by about 17 centimeters (6.5 inches), and may have moved the main island by about 2.4 meters (8 feet). Like other similarly large earthquakes, it also changed the rotation speed of the Earth.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Earthquakes can change the Earth's rotation by rearranging the Earth's mass. This is what a spinning ice skater does to make herself spin faster. She moves her arms closer to her body, she's moving her mass closer to the axis about which she's rotating,\" Dr. Richard Gross of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory explained to Popular Mechanics in 2011. \"And earthquakes do the same thing.\"\n\n\"This earthquake must've moved the mass on average a bit closer to the Earth's rotation axis to make the Earth rotate faster and the length of the day a bit smaller.\"\n\nBy looking at models of the Earth's mass distribution before the earthquake and using estimates of how the fault slipped during the earthquake, Gross was able to figure out how the mass distribution changed.\n\n\"Then, by conservation of angular momentum, if I know how the Earth's mass was rearranged, then I know how the Earth's rotation must've changed,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll in all, the earthquake sped up the rotation of Earth, by about 1.8 microseconds (1.8 millionths of a second). The Indonesian earthquake in 2004, for comparison, sped up the Earth's day by an estimated 2.68 microseconds.\n\nEarthquakes are not the only events and factors affecting the Earth's rotation speed.\n\n\"Any worldly event that involves the movement of mass affects the Earth's rotation, from seasonal weather down to driving a car,\" Dr. Benjamin Fong Chao, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, explained after the 2004 Indonesian earthquake.\n\nThere are all sorts of factors that affect the speed of rotation, such as changing sea levels and shifts within the Earth, though the biggest factor is that the Moon is moving away from the Earth (who can blame it) and as the two bodies interact, the result is the Earth slowing down, albeit with bursts of speed every now and then.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBy looking at ancient corals, scientists figured out that Earth used to spin a lot faster 444-419 million years ago. Every day, coral puts down a fine layer of calcium as it grows. Since corals grow more in the dry season than wet seasons, you can then count the lines of calcium carbonate deposits in each season and calculate how many days took place in a year. Using this method, the team worked out that Earth had 420 days a year 444-419 million years ago, before slowing down to the influence of our Moon.",

        "description": "A Greymouth teenager thought her home was being rocked by earthquake, when a small tornado tore through her house on Monday night.\n\nAme Millan, said her daughter Zoe Purdie was home alone when the tornado hit their property on Turamaha Street at about 10.30pm.\n\nMillan returned home shortly after to see power lines down which were sparking.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Live: Power cuts, floods, slips, reports of tornado as heavy rain hits South Island\n\n* West Coast Regional Council's millstone: The Grey River gold dredge\n\n* Vehicle and truck collide near Jacksons, West Coast\n\n\n\n\"I went to run in the house and the power line was down here. Zoe went to run out to me and I screamed 'stay in the house\u2019. I had to scream at a cop because he was about to walk into the power line\" she said.\n\n\"We have no house now. It's buggered. We were in emergency housing, and we finally found a house. We've been here a few months making it a home and now this. I'm just glad she is safe.\n\n\u201cShe was freaking out inside. She had to shut herself in her bedroom because there was water all over the floor and the power lines were down.\"\n\nJoanne Naish/Stuff Zoe Purdie thought an earthquake was hitting her home on Turumaha Street in Greymouth, when it was actually a small tornado ripping tin off the roof.\n\nPurdie said: \"I thought it was an earthquake. I didn't look outside. I called my father, and he thought it was an earthquake too then Mum came home, and she told me there was a power pole down, so I thought I'm not moving.\"\n\nMillan said the tornado came from over the railway and crossed past their house. \"Our roof was wrapped around that power pole,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado then moved up towards Tainui Street, where it picked up debris from a recently burnt out building.\n\nThe debris were carried over the road and were thrown through the windows of a motorcycle shop by the winds.\n\nGreymouth RSA manager Fiona Scott said the roof was partially lifted off the RSA hall and debris from the fire-damaged building was dropped onto the bowling green.\n\nJoanne Naish/Stuff The Greymouth RSA lost part of its roof after a tornado on Monday, its believed the tornado travelled 300m.\n\nCars at Greenfields motors, which sits two streets over from Turamaha Street, were damaged by the flying debris.\n\n\"A dozen or more cars have small dents or broken windows. Just what you need. Now we have no power because the tornado took out a power pole. They are out there fixing it now,\" said manager Ross Brown.\n\nGreymouth fire chief Lee Swinburn said: \"We were called about 11.15pm to a house on Turamaha Street where a roof had been dislodged by a tornado. That roof has travelled east for about 100m causing damage to two commercial properties on Tainui Street,\" he said.\n\nThe tornado came from the Blaketown lagoon, over rail yards, took the roof off at Turamaha Street and then travelled over to Tainui Street before fizzling out, he said.\n\nHe estimated it travelled up to 300m in total. There were no injuries and no damage reported in other areas. \"There were short sharp gusts for a period of time until 8am,\" he said.\n\nAsked to confirm if a tornado was in fact recorded in Greymouth overnight, the MetService said its evidence was \u201cinconclusive\u201d, but it was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say for sure if it was a tornado, but there are indications that it could have been,\u201d a Metservice forecaster said.",
