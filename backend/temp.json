Google Voice for Android is now getting a Material You redesign.\n\nThis redesign starts with a tall Material You bottom bar that uses pill-shaped indicators to note your current tab. The FAB (floating action button) has changed from a circle into a rounded square. It does not disappear as you scroll.\n\nAt the top of the screen is a pill-shaped \u201cSearch Google Voice\u201d field, while the navigation drawer has been modernized with rounded top and bottom corners, as well as a wider panel.\n\nDynamic Color is leveraged through the app, replacing the dull gray from before. When you\u2019re viewing a conversation, the status and app bars are not merged.\n\nThe homescreen widgets also get a Material You treatment with a Dynamic Color background and modernized shapes.\n\nThis Voice update follows Google Tasks getting modernized in February. In terms of Android Workspace apps, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and Chat have all been updated. Jamboard is now the only Workspace-adjacent app without a revamp. On the web, Material You is available for Gmail, Drive, and Docs/Sheets/Slides.\n\nVersion 2023.03.20.518941070 of Google Voice for Android rolls out the Material You redesign. It\u2019s not widely rolled out yet via the Play Store.\n\nMore on Google Voice:",

        "description": "Google is adding a new carousel in search results to help you see different perspectives on certain search topics. The feature, called \u201cPerspectives,\u201d is a new box showing \u201cinsights from a range of journalists, experts, and other relevant voices\u201d that will appear under the \u201cTop Stories\u201d box in results.\n\nIn a blog post, the company shared a GIF of what the box looks like for perspectives on this year\u2019s Oscars. It includes tweets from Mark Hamill and Jamie Lee Curtis as well as a few articles. It looks fine, but I\u2019m annoyed that it will be yet another thing cluttering up Google\u2019s search results. (I may just be nostalgic for the good old days.)\n\nGIF: Google\n\nThe perspectives, in this instance, are fairly inoffensive. But it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how this could surface the types of controversial opinions or inaccurate statements that we\u2019re already subject to every day on Twitter. Google says it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to bringing you authoritative and trustworthy information\u201d in the box, and here\u2019s what spokesperson Meghann Farnsworth said about how it decides what will be included:\n\nOur systems automatically identify relevant voices across various platforms, depending on the search query. These systems look at a range of signals to determine if a result will be helpful, including relevance to the story, prominence, language, freshness, expertise and trustworthiness for the topic at hand. As with Search and News as a whole, we design our systems to surface high-quality, reliable information in the Perspectives carousel. When we become aware that content may violate our policies we review it and remove it from Search features where appropriate.\n\nYou\u2019ll start seeing the Perspectives carousel \u201csoon\u201d in English in the US on desktop and mobile, according to Google. The company is adding a few other updates to search as well. The \u201cAbout this result\u201d box you can see when you click the three dots next to a link will get an \u201cAbout this author\u201d section. And that \u201cAbout this result\u201d box will be expanded to \u201call languages where Search is available\u201d in the coming days.",

This, the tech company says, allows the active websites you\u2019re browsing to deliver the \u2018smoothest possible experience\u2019.\n\nAll inactive tabs will be reloaded once you visit them again. Google Chrome\u2019s Memory Saver mode feature is especially useful if you\u2019re running other intensive applications, like editing family videos or playing games.\n\nWondering how to turn on the Memory Saver mode on Google Chrome?\n\nOpen Google Chrome on your laptop/desktop\n\nTap on the three-dot menu that is available next to your profile photo\n\nHere, click on Settings\n\nGo to Performance section\n\nNext, toggle on the Memory Saver mode\n\nReaders must note that the Memory Saver doesn\u2019t disable media playing in the background. This means that users can still play music, YouTube videos and even podcasts in the background. The feature only disables websites that take resources without providing an immediate benefit.\n\nIn another news, Google has started opening access to its generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot called Bard as it seeks public feedback to \u201cimprove its systems\" and take on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Bard can be accessed by users in the US and UK starting today at bard.google.com. It will be released in other regions and in other languages over time, the big tech firm said.\n\nBard was unveiled last month around the same time Microsoft announced AI-powered Bing, which is based on OpenAI's large language model that has been designed especially for search and is more powerful than even ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Bing unveiling didn\u2019t go as expected as the chatbot generated inaccurate information in a promotional video, which wiped out $100 billion in Google parent Alphabet\u2019s market value.",
