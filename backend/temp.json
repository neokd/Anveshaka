        "title": "PM Modi to join top military meet, focus on theaterisation",
        "description": "A top military conference, which began in Bhopal on Thursday and will be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 1, will bring into sharp focus India\u2019s renewed push for theaterisation for the best use of its military\u2019s resources to fight future wars, the operational readiness of the armed forces in the backdrop of the lingering border row with China, and the progress in achieving self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector, officials familiar with the matter said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (ANI/PIB)\n\nRead here: PM Modi reviews new parliament construction during surprise visit\n\nThe three-day Combined Commanders\u2019 Conference is based on the theme Ready, Resurgent, Relevant.\n\n\u201cDuring the conference, deliberations will be held over a varied spectrum of issues pertaining to national security, including jointness and theaterisation in the armed forces,\u201d the PMO said in a statement. \u201cPreparation of the armed forces and progress in defence ecosystem towards attaining \u2018Aatmanirbharta\u2019 (self-reliance) will also be reviewed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheaterisation, operational readiness of the armed forces and self-reliance are the most important issues for the armed forces at the moment. We can expect forward movement in all these areas as the PM is himself providing the directions to make the armed forces stronger,\u201d said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.\n\nThose taking part in the conference include defence minister Rajnath Singh, the chief of defence staff, the three service chiefs, and top commanders of the armed forces. Personnel below officer rank (PBOR) will also take part in conference.\n\n\u201cInclusive and informal interaction will also be held with soldiers, sailors and airmen from army, navy and air force who will contribute to the deliberations,\u201d the PMO said. PBOR took part in the Combined Commanders\u2019 Conference for the first time in 2021 when it was held at Kevadia in Gujarat and attended by the PM.\n\nThe conference comes at a time when the government is pushing a bill in Parliament to empower the commanders of tri-services organisations to take action against service personnel of any of the three services -- serving under existing or future joint commands or institutions -- to ensure discipline and effective discharge of duties.\n\nThe existing legal framework of the armed forces has its limitations when it comes to tri-services matters as officers of one particular service lack the authority to exercise disciplinary and administrative powers over personnel belonging to another service. For instance, a three-star general heading a joint command cannot take action against air force or navy personnel serving under him.\n\nMilitary personnel are currently governed by the respective laws of the three services , the Army Act, 1950, the Air Force Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957.\n\nThe Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Bill, 2023, also seeks to empower the government to notify the setting up of inter-services organisations, including joint services commands --a key goal of the ongoing theaterisation drive -- comprising units and personnel drawn from the three services, and placed under a commander-in-chief.\n\nEfforts to push theaterisation have gathered steam again after General Anil Chauhan took over as CDS in September 2022; the momentum was hit after his predecessor, General Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in December 2021.\n\nThe theaterisation model being pursued under General Rawat sought to set up four integrated commands -- two land-centric theatres, an air defence command and a maritime theatre command. This, however, is being reworked on the back of the Indian Air Force\u2019s reservations about the joint structures that were earlier under consideration. The armed forces have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The army and air force have seven commands each, while the navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands.\n\nRead here: \u2018You will conquer the world\u2019: Karnataka farmer kisses PM Modi's pic| Video\n\nThe situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China is also expected to be discussed during the conference, the officials said.\n\nDespite four rounds of disengagement from Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso, Gogra (PP-17A) and Hot Springs (PP-15), the Indian and Chinese armies still have more than 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in the Ladakh theatre. The Indian and Chinese armies have held 17 rounds of talks so far, but problems at Depsang in Daulet Beg Oldi sector and Charding Nullah Junction (CNJ) in Demchok sector are still on the negotiating table. The two sides have been locked in a standoff for almost three years.\n\nOn March 14, India announced the setting up of a top-level panel to fast-track infrastructure projects in areas close to LAC. The projects being executed in forward areas involve several ministries including defence; road transport and highways; environment, forest and climate change; railways and communications, and power and new and renewable energy.\n\nThe secretaries of these ministries will be part of the new committee.\n\nSelf-reliance in defence will figure prominently on the conference\u2019s agenda, the officials said on a day the defence ministry signed contracts worth \u20b932,100 crore for buying indigenous military hardware to boost the capabilities of the armed forces.\n\nIndia has earmarked 75% of this year\u2019s defence capital procurement budget for buying weapons and systems from local manufacturers, a move aimed at unlocking new opportunities for achieving self-reliance targets and ramping up the country\u2019s defence exports.\n\nThe share of the domestic sector in the defence budget was never higher. India set aside 68% of the military\u2019s capital acquisition budget for making indigenous purchases in 2022-23, 64% in 2021-22, and 58% in 2020-21. Around \u20b91 lakh crore has been set aside for domestic procurement this year, compared to \u20b984,598 crore, \u20b970,221 crore and \u20b951,000 crore in the three previous years.\n\nRead here: Will an Indian spokesperson comment on Germany\u2019s internal issues?\n\nApart from creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware, the government has taken a raft of steps to promote self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) from 49% to 74%, and notifying hundreds of weapons and systems that cannot be imported.",

In our ancient epic, the Mahabharata, the first duty of citizens is described as choosing their own leader. Our sacred Vedas speak of political power being exercised by broad-based consultative bodies. There are also many historical references to Republic states in ancient India, where the rulers were not hereditary. India is, indeed, the mother of democracy.\u201d\n\nDemocracy, he added, is not just a structure, \"it is also a spirit\u201d based on the belief that the needs and aspirations of every human being are equally important. He linked this to one of his earliest slogans as Prime Minister \u2014 \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (striving together for inclusive growth)\u201d.\n\n\"There is much to say about the virtues of democracy, but let me say just this: India, despite the many global challenges, is the fastest-growing major economy today. This itself is the best advertisement for democracy in the world. This itself says that democracy can deliver,\u2019\u2019 Modi said.\n\nThe Summit of Democracy was an election promise made by Biden during his campaign when the US itself was fighting an assault on its democracy by his predecessor Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. Biden conceived it as an exercise to renew democracy at home while confronting autocracies abroad, knowing full well that the Trump years had eroded Washington\u2019s right to grandstand on democracy without some introspection.",

The Prime Minister was speaking at the Democracy Summit he was co-hosting with United States President Joe Biden.\n\nPM Modi also said that India's growing stance on economy was a proof of the fact that the democracy can deliver.\n\n\"India, despite the many global challenges, is the fastest growing major economy today. This itself is the best advertisement for the democracy and the world. This itself says that democracy can deliver,\" he said.\n\nIn a virtual address to the Summit for Democracy, 2023, Modi also said that every initiative of his government is powered by collective efforts of the citizens of India.\n\nModi was speaking at the second Summit for Democracy, co-hosted by US President Joe Biden, Costa Rica President Rodrigo Chaves Robles, Zambia President Hakainde Hichilema, the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte and South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol.\n\nSpeaking during the 'Leader-level Plenary on Democracy Delivering Economic Growth and Shared Prosperity' session hosted by President Yoon, he said the idea of elected leaders was a common feature in ancient India long before the rest of the world.\n\n\"Our epic Mahabharata describes the first duty of citizens as choosing their own leader. Our sacred vedas speak of political power being exercised by broad-based consultative bodies. There are also many historical evidences of republic states in ancient India where rulers were not hereditary,\" Modi said.\n\n\"India indeed is the mother of democracy. Democracy is not just a structure, it is also a spirit. It is based on the belief that the needs and aspirations of every human being are equally important. That is why in India, our guiding philosophy is 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas', meaning striving together for inclusive growth,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether it is our effort to fight climate change through lifestyle changes, to conserve water through distributed storage or provide clean cooking fuel to everyone, every initiative is powered by collective efforts of citizens of India. During Covid-19, India's response was people-driven,\" the prime minister added.\n\nModi said the country's 'vaccine maitri' initative was also guided by the mantra' of 'vasudeva kutumbakam', meaning 'one earth, one family and one future'.",
